  abstract = {Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B negatively regulates the insulin and leptin signaling pathways, and, thus, the clinical application of PTP1B inhibitors to the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity is expected. During our studies on PTP1B inhibitors, two furanosesterterpenes and a C21 furanoterpene were obtained as new types of PTP1B inhibitors from two Indonesian marine sponges. (7E, 12E, 20Z, 18S)-Variabilin (1) and (12E, 20Z, 18S)-8-hydroxyvariabilin (2) from Ircinia sp. and furospongin-1 (3) from Spongia sp. inhibited PTP1B activity with IC50 values of 1.5, 7.1, and 9.9~{$\mu$}M, respectively. The inhibitory activity of compound 1 against T-cell PTP (TCPTP) was approximately 2-fold that against PTP1B, whereas the vaccinia H-1-related phosphatase (VHR) inhibitory effects of 1 were 4-fold weaker than that of its PTP1B inhibitory activity. Compounds 1--3 at 50~{$\mu$}M did not show cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines, hepatoma Huh-7 and bladder carcinoma EJ-1. Compound 1 did not enhance the phosphorylation level of Akt, a key downstream effector of the cascade, in Huh-7 cells.},

The "wild-type" and the PCG mutant structures of the human CYP1b1 protein obtained from comparative modeling were subjected to long molecular dynamics simulations with an intention of studying the possible impact of these mutations on the protein structure and hence its function. Analysis of time evolution as well as time averaged values of various structural properties - especially of those of the functionally important regions: the heme binding region, substrate binding region, and substrate access channel - gave some insights into the possible structural characteristics of the disease mutant and the wild-type forms of the protein. In a nutshell, compared to the wild-type the core regions in the mutant structures are associated with subtle but significant changes, and the functionally important regions seem to adopt such structures that are not conducive for the wild-type-like functionality. {\copyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.}

We have performed molecular dynamics simulations at constant pressure using the GROMOS 45a4 united atom forcefield. To test the forcefield, we computed the density, thermal expansion coefficient, total dipole moment, and dielectric constant of cellulose I{$\beta$}, finding broad agreement with experimental results. We computed infrared (IR) spectra of cellulose I{$\beta$} over the range 300-550 K as a probe of hydrogen bonding. Computed IR spectra were found to agree semi-quantitatively with experiment, especially in the O-H stretching region. We assigned O-H stretches using a novel synthesis of normal mode analysis and power spectrum methods. Simulated IR spectra at elevated temperatures suggest a structural transformation above 450 K, a result in agreement with experimental IR results. The low-temperature (300-400 K) structure of cellulose I{$\beta$} is dominated by intrachain hydrogen bonds, whereas in the high-temperature structure (450-550 K), many of these transform to longer, weaker interchain hydrogen bonds. A three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network emerges at high temperatures due to formation of new interchain hydrogen bonds, which may explain the stability of the cellulose structure at such high temperatures.},

  abstract = {It has recently been suggested by Mu [Proteins 58, 45 (2005)] to use backbone dihedral angles instead of Cartesian coordinates in a principal component analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Dihedral angles may be advantageous because internal coordinates naturally provide a correct separation of internal and overall motion, which was found to be essential for the construction and interpretation of the free energy landscape of a biomolecule undergoing large structural rearrangements. To account for the circular statistics of angular variables, a transformation from the space of dihedral angles \{ {$\Phi$}n \} to the metric coordinate space \{ xn =cos {$\Phi$}n, yn =sin {$\Phi$}n \} was employed. To study the validity and the applicability of the approach, in this work the theoretical foundations underlying the dihedral angle principal component analysis (dPCA) are discussed. It is shown that the dPCA amounts to a one-to-one representation of the original angle distribution and that its principal components can readily be characterized by the corresponding conformational changes of the peptide. Furthermore, a complex version of the dPCA is introduced, in which N angular variables naturally lead to N eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Applying the methodology to the construction of the free energy landscape of decaalanine from a 300 ns molecular dynamics simulation, a critical comparison of the various methods is given. {\copyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {Protein-ligand interactions play key roles in various metabolic pathways, and the proteins involved in these interactions represent major targets for drug discovery. Mol. docking is widely used to predict the structure of protein-ligand complexes, and protein flexibility stands out as one of the most important and challenging issues for binding mode prediction. Various docking methods accounting for protein flexibility have been proposed, tackling problems of ever-increasing dimensionality. This paper presents an overview of conformational sampling methods treating target flexibility during mol. docking. Special attention is given to approaches considering full protein flexibility. Contrary to what is frequently done, this review does not rely on classical biomol. recognition models to classify existing docking methods. Instead, it applies algorithmic considerations, focusing on the level of flexibility accounted for. This review also discusses the diversity of docking applications, from virtual screening (VS) of small drug-like compds. to geometry prediction (GP) of protein-peptide complexes. Considering the diversity of docking methods presented here, deciding which one is the best at treating protein flexibility depends on the system under study and the research application. In VS expts., ensemble docking can be used to implicitly account for large-scale conformational changes, and selective docking can addnl. consider local binding-site rearrangements. In other cases, on-the-fly exploration of the whole protein-ligand complex might be needed for accurate GP of the binding mode. Among other things, future methods are expected to provide alternative binding modes, which will better reflect the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Soc. 119, 7589-7590], which binds to the cytokine IL-2. The small molecule binds to the same site that binds the IL-2 {$\alpha$} receptor and buries into a groove not seen in the free structure of IL-2. Comparison of the bound and several free structures shows this site to be composed of two subsites: one is rigid, and the other is highly adaptive. Thermodynamic data suggest the energy barriers between these conformations are low. The subsites were dissected by using a site-directed screening method called tethering, in which small fragments were captured by disulfide interchange with cysteines introduced into IL-2 around these subsites. X-ray structures with the tethered fragments show that the subsite-binding interactions are similar to those observed with the original small molecule. Moreover, the adaptive subsite tethered many more compounds than did the rigid one. Thus, the adaptive nature of a protein-protein interface provides sites for small molecules to bind and underscores the challenge of applying structure-based design strategies that cannot accurately predict a dynamic protein surface.}

The OD hydroxyl stretch of HOD in H2O is probed with 45-fs pulses that have sufficient bandwidth (\{{$>$}\}400 cm-1) to span the entire broad spectrum. High-quality 2D correlation spectra are obtained having the correct phase relations across the broad hydroxyl band. The correlation spectra are found to evolve on multiple time scales. The time evolution of the vibrational echo correlation spectrum reflects the structural evolution of the hydrogen bond networks. The extended vibrational lifetime of the OD hydroxyl stretch of HOD in H2O facilitates the measurement of hydrogen bond dynamics for longer times than possible in previous studies of the OH stretch. Molecular dynamics simulations/electronic structure calculations are used to obtain the time correlation functions (TCF) for two water models, TIP4P and SPC/E. The TCFs are inputs to full time-dependent diagrammatic perturbation theory calculations, which yield theoretical correlation spectra. Quantitative comparison with the data demonstrates that the two water models somewhat overemphasize the fast fluctuations in water and do not contain a slow enough component to account for the slowest fluctuations. Fits to the data using a phenomenological triexponential TCF yield a slowest component of ?2 ps, and TIP4P and SPC/E have slowest components of \{{$<$}\}1 ps. The TCF obtained from the water models and the triexponential TCF reproduce the linear absorption line shape equally well, but all miss to some extent the asymmetric ?wing? on the low-energy side of the line. Therefore, the time dependence of the vibrational echo correlation spectra provides a good test for the TCF, but the absorption spectrum does not.},

These revised approaches are implemented to calculate IR and isotropic Raman spectra, using the SPC/E simulation model, and the results are in good agreement with experiment. We also calculate observables associated with three-pulse IR echoes: the peak shift and 2D-IR spectrum. The agreement with experiment for the former is improved over our previous calculations, but discrepancies between theory and experiment still exist. Using our proposed definition for hydrogen bonding in liquid water, we decompose the distribution of frequencies in the OH stretch region in terms of subensembles of HOD molecules with different local hydrogen-bonding environments. Such a decomposition allows us to make the connection with experiments and calculations on water clusters and more generally to understand the extent of the relationship between transition frequency and local structure in the liquid.},

  abstract = {IR and Raman (parallel- and perpendicular-polarized) spectra in the OH stretch region for liquid water were measured some years ago, but their interpretation is still controversial. In part, this is because theoretical calculation of such spectra for a neat liquid presents a formidable challenge due to the coupling between vibrational chromophores and the effects of motional narrowing. Recently we proposed an electronic structure/molecular dynamics method for calculating spectra of dilute HOD in liquid D(2)O, which relied on ab initio calculations on clusters to provide a map from nuclear coordinates of the molecules in the liquid to OH stretch frequencies, transition dipoles, and polarizabilities. Here we extend this approach to the calculation of couplings between chromophores. From the trajectories of the fluctuating local-mode frequencies, transition moments, and couplings, we use our recently developed time-averaging approximation to calculate the line shapes. Our results are in good agreement with experiment for the IR and Raman line shapes, and capture the significant differences among them. Our analysis shows that while the coupling between chromophores is relatively modest, it nevertheless produces delocalization of the vibrational eigenstates over up to 12 chromophores, which has a profound effect on the spectroscopy. In particular, our results demonstrate that the peak in the parallel-polarized Raman spectrum at about 3250 wavenumbers is collective in nature.},

The focus of this dissertation is to enrich computational drug development by understanding how collective protein motions are coupled to the aqueous environment.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The epidemiology of infective endocarditis has become more complex with today's myriad healthcare-associated factors that predispose to infection.

CONCLUSIONS Infective endocarditis is a complex disease, and patients with this disease generally require management by a team of physicians and allied health providers with a variety of areas of expertise. The recommendations provided in this document are intended to assist in the management of this uncommon but potentially deadly infection. The clinical variability and complexity in infective endocarditis, however, dictate that these recommendations be used to support and not supplant decisions in individual patient management.},

  abstract = {This review deals with dynamics of water molecules in the hydration layer that surrounds self-assemblies and proteins in aqueous solutions. This topic has not only seen a vigorous upsurge of interest in the past decade1-5 but also has been a subject of investigation for almost half a century now. The basic motivation behind such studies is that they provide valuable information regarding the structure and dynamics of hydration layers and also about the dynamics of self-assemblies and biomolecules themselves. Perhaps the perception about this problem was aptly voiced by Robinson et al. a few years ago when they observed that this "is the most important problem in science that hardly anyone wants to see solved."6 While one may certainly argue over the superlative used and the skepticism voiced, the need for a better understanding of this important problem was apparent. Fortunately, considerable progress has been made in recent years by the combination of a host of experimental, theoretical, and computer simulation techniques. We aim to review a part of this progress. Because the existing literature is huge, my review may not be exhaustive but I hope to address at least some of the key issues. A myriad of anomalous features in the dynamics of neat water have always posed interesting challenges to theoreticians and experimentalists alike. For example, while the viscosity of neat water at room temperature is quite large (for such a small and light molecule) and the rotational relaxation of a water molecule is quite slow (as compared to, for example, acetonitrile), the polar solvation dynamics (SD) in liquid water is exceedingly fast.4,7-27 Clearly, the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network, small moment of inertia, high dipole moment, and high dielectric constant of water combine to give dynamics ranging over wide time scales. The characteristic features of water molecules near an interface,2-4 where the HB network gets locally disrupted, differ significantly from those of bulk and thus pose another set of interesting dynamical problems. This is an important issue because water molecules are found in abundance at the interfaces of proteins and DNA, and they control the structure, function, and reactivity of many natural and biological systems.28-30 Micelles and reverse micelles, microemulsions and foams, lipid vesicles, and hydrogels are some examples of systems where water at the interface is different from that in the bulk. Without the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, the protein structure is not stable and it cannot function. The shell of water around DNA is essential for replication and transcription. Intercalation of anticancer drugs into DNA also involves active participation of water molecules.31 Water-mediated interactions play an important role in biomolecular recognition processes.32 However, the detailed role of water in many of these processes is yet to be established. To emphasize the difference between water molecules at the surface of biomolecules and self-assemblies and those in the bulk, one often represents the former as a hydration layer, which is assumed to be a distinct entity. In Figure 1, we schematically illustrate the so-called hydration layer. Obviously, such a layer is partly real and partly imaginary but it serves a useful purpose. To characterize this layer, one would like to know the time scale of motion of water molecules within it. The dynamics of water in this hydration layer is partly determined by and reflected in the HB lifetime kinetics, which in turn depends on the structure of the layer induced by the macromolecular surface.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of studies exploring the relationship between proteins' equilibrium dynamics and structural changes involved in function. An emerging concept, supported by both theory and experiments, is that under native state conditions proteins have an intrinsic ability to sample conformations that meet functional requirements. A typical example is the ability of enzymes to sample open and closed forms, irrespective of substrate, succeeded by the stabilization of one form (usually closed) upon substrate binding. This ability is structure-encoded, and plays a key role in facilitating allosteric regulation, which suggests complementing the sequence-encodes-structure paradigm of protein science by structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function. The emerging connection implies an evolutionary role in selecting/conserving structures based on their ability to achieve functional dynamics, and in turn, selecting sequences that fold into such 'apt' structures. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Druggability assessment of a target protein has emerged in recent years as an important concept in hit-to-lead optimization. A reliable and physically relevant measure of druggability would allow informed decisions on the risk of investing in a particular target. Here, we define ``druggability'' as a quantitative estimate of binding sites and affinities for a potential drug acting on a specific protein target. In the present study, we describe a new methodology that successfully predicts the druggability and maximal binding affinity for a series of challenging targets, including those that function through allosteric mechanisms. Two distinguishing features of the methodology are (i) simulation of the binding dynamics of a diversity of probe molecules selected on the basis of an analysis of approved drugs and (ii) identification of druggable sites and estimation of corresponding binding affinities on the basis of an evaluation of the geometry and energetics of bound probe clusters. The use of the methodology for a variety of targets such as murine double mutant-2, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, vertebrate kinesin-5 (Eg5), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase provides examples for which the method correctly captures the location and binding affinities of known drugs. It also provides insights into novel druggable sites and the target's structural changes that would accommodate, if not promote and stabilize, drug binding. Notably, the ability to identify high affinity spots even in challenging cases such as PTP1B or Eg5 shows promise as a rational tool for assessing the druggability of protein targets and identifying allosteric or novel sites for drug binding.},

  abstract = {The structural changes that occur on ligand binding to haemoglobin have been studied by comparison of the atomic co-ordinates of human deoxy, horse met and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin, using computer graphics and least-squares fitting methods. The changes that occur on going from deoxy to either of the liganded forms are very similar. These include tertiary structure changes within the {$\alpha$}1{$\beta$}1 dimer and a quaternary structure change in which the packing of {$\alpha$}1{$\beta$}1 against {$\alpha$}2{$\beta$}2 alters. On going from deoxy to liganded haemoglobin, no significant structural change occurs in the central regions of the {$\alpha$}1{$\beta$}1 dimer, including the {$\alpha$}1{$\beta$}1 interface and nearby helices B, C, G and H in both subunits. Movements occur in the outer parts of the dimer, where the haems, F helices and FG corners of both subunits move towards the centre of the molecule. The two haems and the two FG corners come {\textasciitilde}2 {\AA} closer together. One important effect of the changes in both subunits is to translate the F helix across the face of the haem by {\textasciitilde}1 {\AA}. This moves the haem-linked histidine F8 from a position that is asymmetric with respect to the porphyrin nitrogens in deoxy to a more symmetric position in liganded haemoglobin. The motion of the {$\beta$} haem removes the ligand-binding site from the vicinity of Val{$\beta$}E11, which hinders ligand binding in deoxy. The changes in tertiary structure are linked to the quaternary change through the motion of the FG corners. The C helices and FG corners of {$\alpha$}1{$\beta$}1 are in contact with the FG corners and C helices of {$\alpha$}2{$\beta$}2 in both quaternary structures. In the quaternary change the contacts between {$\alpha$}1FG and {$\beta$}2C and between {$\alpha$}2FG and {$\beta$}1C act as "flexible joints" allowing small relative motions. The same side-chains are involved in the contacts in both structures. The contacts between {$\alpha$}1C and {$\beta$}2FG and between {$\alpha$}2C and {$\beta$}1FG act as "switch" regions, having two different stable positions with different side-chains in contact. The change between the two positions involves a relative movement of {\textasciitilde}6 {\AA}. The quaternary structure change to liganded haemoglobin destroys the contacts made by the C-terminal residues of each subunit in deoxy haemoglobin, and these residues rotate freely in the liganded form. These structural results, together with other work, particularly the calculations of Gelin \& Karplus and of Warshel, support a description of the haemoglobin mechanism in which (1) the binding of ligand to the deoxy form is accompanied by steric strain, originating from the particular position of the F helix and of His F8 relative to the haem. (2) The strain leads to decreased stability of the deoxy quaternary structure relative to the liganded quaternary structure, so that the proportion of molecules in the high-affinity form increases as successive ligands bind. (3) The quaternary structure change to the high-affinity form induces tertiary structure changes that reposition the F helix and HisF8 relative to the haem and there is then no strain on ligand binding. In the absence of ligand the deoxy structure is favoured by the greater surface area buried between {$\alpha$}1{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}2{$\beta$}2 in this quaternary structure. Further implications of the structural results are discussed. {\copyright} 1979.},

To evaluate that question requires a close consideration of the many varied and subtle roles that water plays in living cells - a consideration that must be free of both an assumed essentialism that gives water an almost mystical life-giving agency and a traditional tendency to see it as a merely passive solvent. Water is a participant in the "life of the cell," and here I describe some of the features of that active agency. Water's value for molecular biology comes from both the structural and dynamic characteristics of its status as a complex, structured liquid as well as its nature as a polar, protic, and amphoteric reagent. Any discussion of water as life's matrix must, however, begin with an acknowledgment that our understanding of it as both a liquid and a solvent is still incomplete.},

  abstract = {15Nitrogen relaxation experiments were used to characterize the backbone dynamics of two modified forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). In one form, the disulfide between Cys14 and Cys38 in the wild-type protein was selectively reduced and methylated to generate an analog of the final intermediate in the disulfide-coupled folding pathway. The second form was generated by similarly modifying a mutant protein in which Tyr35 was replaced with Gly (Y35G). For both selectively reduced proteins, the overall conformation of native BPTI was retained, and the relaxation data for these proteins were compared with those obtained previously with the native wild-type and Y35G proteins. Removing the disulfide from either protein had only small effects on the observed longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) or heteronuclear cross relaxation rates (nuclear Overhauser effect), suggesting that the 14-38 disulfide has little influence on the fast (ps to ns) backbone dynamics of either protein. In the wild-type protein, the pattern of residues undergoing slower ({$\mu$}s to ms) internal motions, reflected in unusually large transverse relaxation rates (R2), was also largely unaffected by the removal of this disulfide. It thus appears that the large R2rates previously observed in native wild-type protein are not a direct consequence of isomerization of the 14-38 disulfide. In contrast with the wild-type protein, reducing the disulfide in Y35G BPTI significantly decreased the number of backbone amides displaying large R2rates. In addition, the frequencies of the backbone motions in the modified protein, estimated from R2values measured at multiple refocusing delays, appear to span a wider range than those seen in native Y35G BPTI. Together, these observations suggest that the slow internal motions in Y35G BPTI are more independent in the absence of the 14-38 disulfide and that formation of this bond may lead to a substantial loss of conformational entropy. These effects may account for the previous observation that the Y35G substitution greatly destabilizes the disulfide. The results also demonstrate that the disulfide and the buried side-chain influence the dynamics of the folded protein in a highly cooperative fashion, with the effects of removing either being much greater in the absence of the other.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins reveal the existence of many transient surface pockets; however, the factors determining what small subset of these represent druggable or functionally relevant ligand binding sites, called ``cryptic sites,'' are not understood. Here, we examine multiple X-ray structures for a set of proteins with validated cryptic sites, using the computational hot spot identification tool FTMap. The results show that cryptic sites in ligand-free structures generally have a strong binding energy hot spot very close by. As expected, regions around cryptic sites exhibit above-average flexibility, and close to 50\% of the proteins studied here have unbound structures that could accommodate the ligand without clashes. Nevertheless, the strong hot spot neighboring each cryptic site is almost always exploited by the bound ligand, suggesting that binding may frequently involve an induced fit component. We additionally evaluated the structural basis for cryptic site formation, by comparing unbound to bound structures. Cryptic sites are most frequently occluded in the unbound structure by intrusion of loops (22.5\%), side chains (19.4\%), or in some cases entire helices (5.4\%), but motions that create sites that are too open can also eliminate pockets (19.4\%). The flexibility of cryptic sites frequently leads to missing side chains or loops (12\%) that are particularly evident in low resolution crystal structures. An interesting observation is that cryptic sites formed solely by the movement of side chains, or of backbone segments with fewer than five residues, result only in low affinity binding sites with limited use for drug discovery.},

The combined effects of the hydration level and temperature on the retardation of the single-particle motions are discussed in the light of available NMR relaxation data and of a well known model of {$\alpha$}-relaxation from the theory of kinetic glass transitions in dense supercooled fluids. The vibrational density of states of interfacial water is presented as a function of temperature and for two levels of hydration of the protein.}

  abstract = {Background: Sulfatases catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfuric acid esters from a wide variety of substrates including glycosaminoglycans, glycolipids and steroids. There is sufficient common sequence similarity within the class of sulfatase enzymes to indicate that they have a common structure. Deficiencies of specific lysosomal sulfatases that are involved in the degradation of glycosamino-glycans lead to rare inherited clinical disorders termed mucopolysaccharidoses. In sufferers of multiple sulfatase deficiency, all sulfatases are inactive because an essential posttranslational modification of a specific active-site cysteine residue to oxo-alanine does not occur. Studies of this disorder have contributed to location and characterization of the sulfatase active site. To understand the catalytic mechanism of sulfatases, and ultimately the determinants of their substrate specificities, we have determined the structure of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase. Results: The crystal structure of the enzyme has been solved and refined at 2.5 {\AA} resolution using data recorded at both 123K and 273K. The structure has two domains, the larger of which belongs to the {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} class of proteins and contains the active site. The enzyme active site in the crystals contains several hitherto undescribed features. The active-site cysteine residue, Cys91, is found as the sulfate derivative of the aldehyde species, oxo-alanine. The sulfate is bound to a previously undetected metal ion, which we have identified as calcium. The structure of a vanadate-inhibited form of the enzyme has also been solved, and this structure shows that vanadate has replaced sulfate in the active site and that the vanadate is covalently linked to the protein. Preliminary data is presented for crystals soaked in the monosaccharide N-acetylgalactosamine, the structure of which forms a product complex of the enzyme. Conclusions: The structure of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase reveals that residues conserved amongst the sulfatase family are involved in stabilizing the calcium ion and the sulfate ester in the active site. This suggests an archetypal fold for the family of sulfatases. A catalytic role is proposed for the posttranslationally modified highly conserved cysteine residue. Despite a lack of any previously detectable sequence similarity to any protein of known structure, the large sulfatase domain that contains the active site closely resembles that of alkaline phosphatase; the calcium ion in sulfatase superposes on one of the zinc ions in alkaline phosphatase and the sulfate ester of Cys91 superposes on the phosphate ion found in the active site of alkaline phosphatase.},

Overall, 13 water molecules were found to be conserved in at least 45 structures, including two water positions which were found to be conserved in all structures. Of the 13 conserved water molecules, 6 are located at the {\textohm}-loop, forming a dense cluster with hydrogen bonds to residues at the {\textohm}-loop as well as to the rest of the protein. This layer of conserved water molecules is packed between the {\textohm}-loop and the rest of the protein and acts as structural glue, which could reduce the flexibility of the {\textohm}-loop. A correlation between conserved water molecules and conserved protein residues could in general not be detected, with the exception of the conserved water molecules at the {\textohm}-loop. Furthermore, the evolutionary relationship between the three families, derived from the number of conserved water molecules, is similar to the relationship derived from phylogenetic analysis.

The interpretation of these experiments depends critically upon the construction of the solvation correlation function, C(t), which describes the time-dependence of the Stokes shift and hence the dielectric response of the medium to a change in charge distribution. We provide an analysis of various methods of constructing this function and review selected examples from the literature. The naturally occurring amino acid, tryptophan, has been frequently used as a probe of solvation dynamics in proteins. Its nonexponential fluorescence decay has stimulated the generation of an alternative method of constructing C(t). In order to evaluate this method, we have studied a system mimicking tryptophan. The system is comprised of two coumarins (C153 and C152) having different fluorescence lifetimes but similar solvation times. The coumarins are combined in different proportions in methanol to make binary probe mixtures. We use fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy to obtain wavelength-resolved kinetics of the individual coumarins in methanol as well as the binary mixtures of 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75 of C153:C152. The solvation correlation functions are constructed for these systems using different methods and are compared. {\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.}

Such advances have been driven not only by new theoretical models and pharmacological applications of allostery; but also by progress in the experimental approaches designed to map allosteric sites and transitions. Among these techniques; NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here; we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions. The picture of the allosteric ``NMR toolbox'' is provided starting from one of the simplest models of allostery (i.e.; the four-state thermodynamic cycle) and continuing to more complex multistate mechanisms. We also review how such an ``NMR toolbox'' has assisted the elucidation of the allosteric molecular basis for disease-related mutations and the discovery of novel leads for allosteric drugs. From this overview; it is clear that NMR plays a central role not only in experimentally validating transformative theories of allostery; but also in tapping the full translational potential of allosteric systems.},

  abstract = {The discovery of drug-like molecules that bind pockets in proteins that are not present in crystallographic structures yet exert allosteric control over activity has generated great interest in designing pharmaceuticals that exploit allosteric effects. However, there have only been a small number of successes, so the therapeutic potential of these pockets-called hidden allosteric sites-remains unclear. One challenge for assessing their utility is that rational drug design approaches require foreknowledge of the target site, but most hidden allosteric sites are only discovered when a small molecule is found to stabilize them. We present a means of decoupling the identification of hidden allosteric sites from the discovery of drugs that bind them by drawing on new developments in Markov state modeling that provide unprecedented access to microsecond- to millisecond-timescale fluctuations of a protein's structure. Visualizing these fluctuations allows us to identify potential hidden allosteric sites, which we then test via thiol labeling experiments. Application of these methods reveals multiple hidden allosteric sites in an important antibiotic target-TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase. This result supports the hypothesis that there are many as yet undiscovered hidden allosteric sites and suggests our methodology can identify such sites, providing a starting point for future drug design efforts. More generally, our results demonstrate the power of using Markov state models to guide experiments.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen-deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a widely applied biophysical technique that probes the structure and dynamics of biomolecules without the need for site-directed modifications or bio-orthogonal labels. The mechanistic interpretation of HDX data, however, is often qualitative and subjective, owing to a lack of quantitative methods to rigorously translate observed deuteration levels into atomistic structural information. To help address this problem, we have developed a methodology to generate structural ensembles that faithfully reproduce HDX-MS measurements. In this approach, an ensemble of protein conformations is first generated, typically using molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-entropy bias is then applied post hoc to the resulting ensemble such that averaged peptide-deuteration levels, as predicted by an empirical model, agree with target values within a given level of uncertainty. We evaluate this approach, referred to as HDX ensemble reweighting (HDXer), for artificial target data reflecting the two major conformational states of a binding protein. We demonstrate that the information provided by HDX-MS experiments and by the model of exchange are sufficient to recover correctly weighted structural ensembles from simulations, even when the relevant conformations are rarely observed. Degrading the information content of the target data---e.g., by reducing sequence coverage, by averaging exchange levels over longer peptide segments, or by incorporating different sources of uncertainty---reduces the structural accuracy of the reweighted ensemble but still allows for useful insights into the distinctive structural features reflected by the target data. Finally, we describe a quantitative metric to rank candidate structural ensembles according to their correspondence with target data and illustrate the use of HDXer to describe changes in the conformational ensemble of the membrane protein LeuT. In summary, HDXer is designed to facilitate objective structural interpretations of HDX-MS data and to inform experimental approaches and further developments of theoretical exchange models.},

Its utility as a predictive tool for binding site identification is tested by predicting known binding sites of proteins in the PDB using both complexed macromolecules and their corresponding apo-protein structures. The results indicate that PASS can serve as a front-end to fast docking. The main utility of PASS lies in the fact that it can analyze a moderate-size protein ({\textasciitilde}30 kDa) in under 20 s, which makes it suitable for interactive molecular modeling, protein database analysis, and aggressive virtual screening efforts. As a modeling tool, PASS (i) rapidly identifies favorable regions of the protein surface, (ii) simplifies visualization of residues modulating binding in these regions, and (iii) provides a means of directly visualizing buried volume, which is often inferred indirectly from curvature in a surface representation. PASS produces output in the form of standard PDB files, which are suitable for any modeling package, and provides script files to simplify visualization in Cerius2{\textregistered}, InsightII{\textregistered}, MOE{\textregistered}, Quanta{\textregistered}, RasMol{\textregistered}, and Sybyl{\textregistered}, PASS is freely available to all.},

They introduce two variables that are able to describe the position of a point in configurational space relative to a preassigned path. With the help of these two variables the authors combine features of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established. Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated. The authors exemplify the method numerically by studying the conformational changes of alanine dipeptide.},

GROma{$\rho$}s efficiently computes density maps by fast multi-Gaussian spreading of atomic densities onto a three-dimensional grid. It complements existing map-based tools by enabling spatial inspection of atomic average localization during the simulations. Most importantly, it allows the comparison between computed and reference maps (e.g., experimental) through calculation of difference maps and local and time-resolved global correlation. These comparison operations proved useful to quantitatively contrast perturbed and control simulation data sets and to examine how much biomolecular systems resemble both synthetic and experimental density maps. This was especially advantageous for multimolecule systems in which standard comparisons like RMSDs are difficult to compute. In addition, GROma{$\rho$}s incorporates absolute and relative spatial free-energy estimates to provide an energetic picture of atomistic localization. This is an open-source GROMACS-based toolset, thus allowing for static or dynamic selection of atoms or even coarse-grained beads for the density calculation. Furthermore, masking of regions was implemented to speed up calculations and to facilitate the comparison with experimental maps. Beyond map comparison, GROma{$\rho$}s provides a straightforward method to detect solvent cavities and average charge distribution in biomolecular systems. We employed all these functionalities to inspect the localization of lipid and water molecules in aquaporin systems, the binding of cholesterol to the G protein coupled chemokine receptor type 4, and the identification of permeation pathways through the dermicidin antimicrobial channel. Based on these examples, we anticipate a high applicability of GROma{$\rho$}s for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations and their comparison with experimentally determined densities.},

The heavy-atom frequency spectrum shows a dense distribution between 3 and 1,800 cm-1, with 350 modes below 216 cm-1. Most of the low-frequency modes, of which many have significant anharmonic character, are found to be delocalized over the protein. The root-mean-square amplitudes of the atomic fluctuations are calculated at 300 K from the normal modes and compared with those obtained from a solution molecular dynamics simulation based on the same potential function; very good agreement is obtained for the variation in the main-chain fluctuations as a function of residue number, though larger differences occur for the side chains. The fluctuations are generally, though not always, dominated by frequencies below 30 cm-1, in accord with the results of the dynamics simulation. The vibrational contributions to the thermodynamic properties of the protein are calculated as a function of temperature; the effects of perturbations on the spectrum, suggested for ligand or substrate binding, are examined. The analysis demonstrates that, in spite of the anharmonic contributions to the potential, a normal mode description can provide useful results concerning the internal motions of proteins.},

  abstract = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.}

The protein structures have been characterized in the two photoswitch states through NMR spectroscopy and the transition between them through ultrafast IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding groove opens on a 100-ns timescale in a highly nonexponential manner, and the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the process is governed by the rearrangement of the water network on the protein surface.

  abstract = {Recently, natural variants of TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase with amino acid substitutions at residues 237-240 have been identified that have increased hydrolytic activity for extended-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidime. To identify the sequence requirements in this region for a given antibiotic, a random library was constructed that contained all possible amino acid combinations for the 3-residue region 237-240 (ABL numbering system) of TEM- 1 {$\beta$}-lactamase. An antibiotic disc diffusion method was used to select mutants with wild-type level activity or greater for the extended-spectrum cephalosporin ceftazidime and the monobactam aztreonam. Mutants that were selected for optimal ceftazidime hydrolysis contained a conserved Ala at position 237, a Ser for Gly substitution at position 238, and a Lys for Glu at position 240. Mutants selected for aztreonam hydrolysis exhibited a Gly for Ala substitution at position 237, a Ser for Gly substitution at position 238, and a Lys/Arg for Glu at position 240. The role of the A237G substitution in differentiating between ceftazidime and aztreonam was further investigated by kinetic analysis of the A237G, E240K, G238S:E240K, and A237G:G238S:E240K enzymes. The A237G single mutant and the G238S:E240K double mutant exhibited increases in catalytic efficiency for both ceftazidime and aztreonam. However, the triple mutant A237G:G238S:E240K, displayed a 12-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for ceftazidime but a 3-fold increase for aztreonam relative to the G238S:E240K double mutant. Thus, the A237G substitution increases ceftazidime hydrolysis when present alone but antagonizes ceftazidime hydrolysis when it is combined with the G238S:E240K substitutions. In contrast, the A237G substitution acts additively with the G238S:E240K substitutions to increase aztreonam hydrolysis.},

  abstract = {Mossbauer spectroscopy and neutron scattering measurements on proteins embedded in solvents including water and aqueous mixtures have emphasized the observation of the distinctive temperature dependence of the atomic mean square displacements, {$<$}u2{$>$}, commonly referred to as the dynamic transition at some temperature Td. At low temperatures, {$<$}u2{$>$} increases slowly, but it assume stronger temperature dependence after crossing Td, which depends on the time/frequency resolution of the spectrometer. Various authors have made connection of the dynamics of solvated proteins including the dynamic transition to that of glass-forming substances. Notwithstanding, no connection is made to the similar change of temperature dependence of {$<$}u2{$>$} obtained by quasielastic neutron scattering when crossing the glass transition temperature Tg, generally observed in inorganic, organic and polymeric glass-formers. Evidences are presented to show that such change of the temperature dependence of {$<$}u2{$>$} from neutron scattering at Tg is present in hydrated or solvated proteins, as well as in the solvents used unsurprisingly since the latter is just another organic glass-formers. The {$<$}u2{$>$} obtained by neutron scattering at not so low temperatures has contributions from the dissipation of molecules while caged by the anharmonic intermolecular potential at times before dissolution of cages by the onset of the Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxation. The universal change of {$<$}u2{$>$} at Tg of glass-formers had been rationalized by sensitivity to change in volume and entropy of the beta-relaxation, which is passed onto the dissipation of the caged molecules and its contribution to {$<$}u2{$>$}. The same rationalization applies to hydrated and solvated proteins for the observed change of {$<$}u2{$>$} at Tg.},

Numerous structure- and sequence-based methods have been developed for this problem. Here we introduce ConCavity, a small molecule binding site prediction algorithm that integrates evolutionary sequence conservation estimates with structurebased methods for identifying protein surface cavities. In large-scale testing on a diverse set of single- and multi-chain protein structures, we show that ConCavity substantially outperforms existing methods for identifying both 3D ligand binding pockets and individual ligand binding residues. As part of our testing, we perform one of the first direct comparisons of conservation-based and structure-based methods. We find that the two approaches provide largely complementary information, which can be combined to improve upon either approach alone. We also demonstrate that ConCavity has state-of-the-art performance in predicting catalytic sites and drug binding pockets. Overall, the algorithms and analysis presented here significantly improve our ability to identify ligand binding sites and further advance our understanding of the relationship between evolutionary sequence conservation and structural and functional attributes of proteins. Data, source code, and prediction visualizations are available on the ConCavity web site (http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/concavity/). {\copyright} 2009 Capra et al.}

We assembled di-ubiquitins (Ub2) comprising every lysine linkage and examined them biochemically and structurally. Of these, K27-Ub2 is unique as it is not cleaved by most deubiquitinases. As this remains the only structurally uncharacterized lysine linkage, we comprehensively examined the structures and dynamics of K27-Ub2 using nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle neutron scattering, and in silico ensemble modeling. Our structural data provide insights into the functional properties of K27-Ub2, in particular that K27-Ub2 may be specifically recognized by K48-selective receptor UBA2 domain from proteasomal shuttle protein hHR23a. Binding studies and mutagenesis confirmed this prediction, further highlighting structural/recognition versatility of polyubiquitins and the potential power of determining function from elucidation of conformational ensembles.}

  abstract = {Summary Polyubiquitination, a critical protein post-translational modification, signals for a diverse set of cellular events via the different isopeptide linkages formed between the C terminus of one ubiquitin (Ub) and the E-amine of K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, or K63 of a second Ub. We assembled di-ubiquitins (Ub2) comprising every lysine linkage and examined them biochemically and structurally. Of these, K27-Ub2 is unique as it is not cleaved by most deubiquitinases. As this remains the only structurally uncharacterized lysine linkage, we comprehensively examined the structures and dynamics of K27-Ub2 using nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle neutron scattering, and in silico ensemble modeling. Our structural data provide insights into the functional properties of K27-Ub2, in particular that K27-Ub2 may be specifically recognized by K48-selective receptor UBA2 domain from proteasomal shuttle protein hHR23a. Binding studies and mutagenesis confirmed this prediction, further highlighting structural/recognition versatility of polyubiquitins and the potential power of determining function from elucidation of conformational ensembles.},

  abstract = {Studies of protein dynamics at low temperatures are generally performed on hydrated powders and not in biologically realistic solutions of water because of water crystallization. However, here we avoid the problem of crystallization by reducing the size of the biomolecules. We have studied oligomers of the amino acid l-lysine, fully dissolved in water, and our dielectric relaxation data show that the glass transition-related dynamics of the oligomers is determined by the water dynamics, in a way similar to that previously observed for solvated proteins. This implies that the crucial role of water for protein dynamics can be extended to other types of macromolecular systems, where water is also able to determine their conformational fluctuations. Using the energy landscape picture of macromolecules, the thermodynamic criterion for such solvent-slaved macromolecular motions may be that the macromolecules need the entropy contribution from the solvent to overcome the enthalpy barriers between different conformational substates.}

This is particularly important for molecules that sample conformational states on a timescale similar to molecular reorientation. The package is tested on sucrose and results are shown to differ in small but significant ways from those calculated using an inverse sixth power assumption. Results are also compared to experiment and found to be in reasonable agreement despite an expected underestimation of water viscosity by the water model selected.},

These methods make use of summations of ring and chain cluster diagrams. The summations are performed explicitly for certain classes of molecular models. The molecules in these classes contain several "interaction sites," and the total interaction between two molecules is a sum of site-site potentials that depend on the scalar distances between sites on the two molecules. The principal results of this work are computationally simple techniques for calculating the thermodynamic properties and pair correlation functions of molecular fluids in which the intermolecular interactions are highly angular dependent. The techniques should be reliable since they arise from the same approximations that have been shown to be very accurate when applied to simple fluids.}

The influence functional, i.e., the solvent induced potential between different sites on the polymer, is estimated from the RISM integral equation. The functional is not pair decomposable and the resulting polymer problem is not trivial to solve. The evaluation of the electron partition function and correlation functions is pursued with two approximations: (i) a mean field approximation which neglects the role of polymer fluctuations on the solvent induced interactions: (ii) a polaron approximation which is a linear approximation in the sense that it neglects large fluctuations in the polymer structure itself.

In a hydrated protein, at temperatures {$\geq$}220 K, this flexibility is restored, and the protein is able to sample more conformational substates, thus becoming biologically functional. This "dynamical" transition of protein is believed to be triggered by its strong coupling with the hydration water, which also shows a similar dynamic transition. Here we demonstrate experimentally that this sudden switch in dynamic behavior of the hydration water on lysozyme occurs precisely at 220 K and can be described as a fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover. At the fragile-to-strong dynamic crossover, the structure of hydration water makes a transition from predominantly high-density (more fluid state) to low-density (less fluid state) forms derived from the existence of the second critical point at an elevated pressure. {\copyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {Water plays a critical role in the structure and function of proteins; although the experimental properties of water around protein structures are not well understood. The water can be classified by the separation from the protein surface into bulk water and hydration water. Hydration water interacts closely with the protein and contributes to protein folding; stability and dynamics; as well as interacting with the bulk water. Water potential functions are often parameterized to fit bulk water properties because of the limited experimental data for hydration water. Therefore; the structural and energetic properties of the hydration water were assessed for 105 atomic resolution ({$\leq$}1.0 {\AA}) protein crystal structures with a high level of hydration water by calculating the experimental water-protein radial distribution function or surface distribution function (SDF) and water radial distribution function (RDF). Two maxima are observed in SDF: the first maximum at a radius of 2.75 {\AA} reflects first shell and hydrogen bond interactions between protein and water; the second maximum at 3.65 {\AA} reflects second shell and van der Waals interactions between water and non-polar atoms of protein forming clathrate-hydrate-like structures. Thus; the two shells do not overlap. The RDF showed the features of liquid water rather than solid ice. The first and second maxima of RDF at 2.75 and 4.5 {\AA}; respectively; are the same as for bulk water; but the peaks are sharper indicating hydration water is more stable than bulk water. Both distribution functions are inversely correlated with the distribution of B factors (atomic thermal factors) for the waters; suggesting that the maxima reflect stable positions. Therefore; the average water structure near the protein surface has experimentally observable differences from bulk water. This analysis will help improve the accuracy for models of water on the protein surface by providing rigorous data for the effects of the apparent chemical potential of the water near a protein surface.},

DXP is not utilized by humans; hence, DXPS has been an attractive antibacterial target. Here, we investigate DXPS from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrDXPS), showing that it has similar kinetic parameters Kmd-GAP and Kmpyruvate (54 {\textpm} 3 and 11 {\textpm} 1 {$\mu$}m, respectively) and comparable catalytic activity (kcat = 45 {\textpm} 2 min-1) with previously studied bacterial DXPS enzymes and employing it to obtain missing structural data on this enzyme family. In particular, we have determined crystallographic snapshots of DrDXPS in two states along the reaction coordinate: a structure of DrDXPS bound to C2{$\alpha$}-phosphonolactylThDP (PLThDP), mimicking the native pre-decarboxylation intermediate C2{$\alpha$}-lactylThDP (LThDP), and a native post-decarboxylation state with a bound enamine intermediate. The 1.94-{\AA}-resolution structure of PLThDP-bound DrDXPS delineates how two active-site histidine residues stabilize the LThDP intermediate. Meanwhile, the 2.40-{\AA}-resolution structure of an enamine intermediate-bound DrDXPS reveals how a previously unknown 17-{\AA} conformational change removes one of the two histidine residues from the active site, likely triggering LThDP decarboxylation to form the enamine intermediate. These results provide insight into how the bi-substrate enzyme DXPS limits side reactions by arresting the reaction on the less reactive LThDP intermediate when its cosubstrate is absent. They also offer a molecular basis for previous low-resolution experimental observations that correlate decarboxylation of LThDP with protein conformational changes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Although tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable disease, it still impacts highly on the morbidity and mortality of people in sub-Saharan Africa. This is largely attributed to drug resistance to the currently available drugs as well as co-infection with HIV. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB has necessitated the urgent need for the development of new drugs. DNA Gyrase B, a previously validated target for the aminocoumarins poses an attractive enzyme to target for the development of novel potent drugs. Previous biochemical assays suggest that the inhibitor diospyrin, binds to a novel binding site, close to the ATP binding site of the N-terminal domain of Gyrase B. To date, however, no available crystal structure of diospyrin in complex with Gyrase B has been reported. Thus, to investigate the position of this potential binding site, a robust homology model was built and validated, followed by docking and MD simulations. Thermodynamic calculations were used to estimate binding affinity. Binding free energy calculations revealed subtle differences in the binding at each site, however, the comprehensive computational analyses presented here, provide a substantially extensive illustration of the binding themes and affinities for each site, which offer value for the further design of novel inhibitors.},

This approach relies on the continuous estimation of a biasing force that yields a Hamiltonian in which no average force is exerted along the ordering parameter {$\xi$}. Optimizing the parameters that control how the ABF is applied, the method is shown to be extremely effective when a nonequivocal ordering parameter can be defined to explore the folding pathway of the peptide. Starting from a {$\beta$}-turn motif and restraining {$\xi$} to a region of the conformational space that extends from the {$\alpha$}-helical state to an ensemble of extended structures, the ABF scheme is successful in folding the peptide chain into a compact {$\alpha$} helix. Sampling of this conformation is, however, marginal when the range of {$\xi$} values embraces arrangements of greater compactness, hence demonstrating the inherent limitations of free-energy methods when ambiguous ordering parameters are utilized.},

MSMs can predict both stationary and kinetic quantities on long timescales (e.g. milliseconds) using a set of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that are individually much shorter, thus addressing the well-known sampling problem in molecular dynamics simulation. In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments. A variety of methodological advances and software packages now bring the construction of these models closer to routine practice.

Mutations that impart resistance to camptothecin have been identified in several regions of human topoisomerase I. We present the crystal structures of two camptothecin-resistant forms of human topoisomerase I (Phe361Ser at 2.6{\AA} resolution and Asn722Ser at 2.3{\AA} resolution) in ternary complexes with DNA and topotecan (Hycamtin{\textregistered}), a camptothecin analogue currently in widespread clinical use. While the alteration of Asn722 to Ser leads to the elimination of a water-mediated contact between the enzyme and topotecan, we were surprised to find that a well-ordered water molecule replaces the hydrophobic phenylalanine side-chain in the Phe361Ser structure. We further consider camptothecin- resistant mutations at seven additional sites in human topoisomerase I and present structural evidence explaining their possible impact on drug binding. These results advance our understanding of the mechanism of cell poisoning by camptothecin and suggest specific modifications to the drug that may improve efficacy. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In Gram-negative bacteria, QS is often mediated by N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (acyl-HSLs). Because QS influences the virulence of many pathogenic bacteria, synthetic inhibitors of acyl-HSL synthases might be useful therapeutically for controlling pathogens. However, rational design of a potent QS antagonist has been thwarted by the lack of information concerning the binding interactions between acyl-HSL synthases and their ligands. In the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia glumae, QS controls virulence, motility, and protein secretion and is mediated by the binding of N-octanoyl-L-HSL (C8-HSL) to its cognate receptor, TofR. C8-HSL is synthesized by the acyl-HSL synthase TofI. In this study, we characterized two previously unknown QS inhibitors identified in a focused library of acyl-HSL analogs. Our functional and X-ray crystal structure analyses show that the first inhibitor, J8-C8, binds to TofI, occupying the binding site for the acyl chain of the TofI cognate substrate, acylated acyl-carrier protein. Moreover, the reaction byproduct, 5{$\prime$}-methylthioadenosine, independently binds to the binding site for a second substrate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Closer inspection of the mode of J8-C8 binding to TofI provides a likely molecular basis for the various substrate specificities of acyl-HSL synthases. The second inhibitor, E9C-3oxoC6, competitively inhibits C8-HSL binding to TofR. Our analysis of the binding of an inhibitor and a reaction byproduct to an acyl-HSL synthase may facilitate the design of a new class of QS-inhibiting therapeutic agents.}

Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales inaccessible in standard simulations. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. For a model system and chignolin in explicit water, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting in molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We use these accelerated simulations to infer important kinetic observables such as the unbiased mean first-passage time and direct transit time. For the latter, Metadynamics with informed resetting leads to speedups of 2--3 orders of magnitude over unbiased simulations with relative errors of only {$\sim$}35--70\%. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {Many proteins have small-molecule binding pockets that are not easily detectable in the ligand-free structures. These cryptic sites require a conformational change to become apparent; a cryptic site can therefore be defined as a site that forms a pocket in a holo structure, but not in the apo structure. Because many proteins appear to lack druggable pockets, understanding and accurately identifying cryptic sites could expand the set of drug targets. Previously, cryptic sites were identified experimentally by fragment-based ligand discovery and computationally by long molecular dynamics simulations and fragment docking. Here, we begin by constructing a set of structurally defined apo-holo pairs with cryptic sites. Next, we comprehensively characterize the cryptic sites in terms of their sequence, structure, and dynamics attributes. We find that cryptic sites tend to be as conserved in evolution as traditional binding pockets but are less hydrophobic and more flexible. Relying on this characterization, we use machine learning to predict cryptic sites with relatively high accuracy (for our benchmark, the true positive and false positive rates are 73\% and 29\%, respectively). We then predict cryptic sites in the entire structurally characterized human proteome (11,201 structures, covering 23\% of all residues in the proteome). CryptoSite increases the size of the potentially "druggable" human proteome from {$\sim$}40\% to {$\sim$}78\% of disease-associated proteins. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of our approach in practice, we experimentally validate a cryptic site in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B using a covalent ligand and NMR spectroscopy.

  abstract = {Calculations of lipid bilayer permeabilities from first principles, using molecular simulations, would be valuable to rapidly assess the bioavailability of drug candidates, as well as to decipher, at the atomic level, the mechanisms that underlie the translocation of permeants. The most common theoretical approach, the solubility-diffusion model, requires determination of the free energy and the diffusivity as functions of the position of the permeant. Quantitative predictions of permeability have, however, been stymied by acute difficulties in calculating the diffusivity, inadequate sampling, and, most insidiously, systematic biases due to imperfections in the force field, simulation parameters, and the inherent limitations of the diffusive model. In the present work, we combine importance-sampling simulations employing an adaptive biasing force with a Bayesian-inference algorithm to determine the free energy and diffusivity with noteworthy precision and spatial resolution. In multimicrosecond simulations, we probe the sensitivity of the permeability estimates to different aspects of the methodology, including the truncation of short-range interactions, the thermostat, the force-field parameters of the permeant, the time scale over which the diffusivity is estimated, and the size of the simulated system. The force-field parameters and time scale dependence of the diffusivities impose the greatest uncertainties on the permeability estimates. Our simulations highlight the importance of membrane distortion due to the presence of the permeant, which may be partially suppressed if the bilayer patch is not large enough. We suggest that improvements to force fields and more robust kinetic models may be needed to reduce systematic errors below a factor of two. {\copyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.}

Here, we provide a significant advance in characterizing this coupling; we present the first full study of both the longitudinal and transverse coherent collective motions in a protein-solvent system. The data show unexpectedly the presence in the water dynamics of collective modes belonging to the protein. The properties of these modes, in particular, their propagation velocities and amplitudes, indicate a strengthening of the interactions and a higher rigidity of the network of solvent molecules close to the protein surface. Accordingly, the present study presents the most compelling and clear evidence of a very strong dynamical coupling between a protein and its hydration water, previously suggested by studies using various experimental techniques.},

  abstract = {A general model is presented whereby lignand-induced changes in protein dynamics could produce allosteric communication between distinct binding sites, even in the absence of a macromolecular conformational change. Theoretical analysis, based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative interaction free energies amounting to several kJ {$\cdot$} mol-1 may be generated by this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism. We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean. {\copyright} 1984 Springer-Verlag.},

Their relevance has motivated intense research activity seeking to characterize their sequence/structure/function relationships. However, the conformational plasticity of these molecules hampers the application of traditional structural approaches, and new tools and concepts are being developed to address the challenges they pose. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is a structural biology technique that probes the size and shape of disordered proteins and their complexes with other biomolecules. The low-resolution nature of SAS can be compensated with specially designed computational tools and its combined interpretation with complementary structural information. In this review, we describe recent advances in the application of SAS to disordered proteins and highly flexible complexes and discuss current challenges.},

Standard, but powerful numerical methods can be used to estimate the solute-solvent PMF from which the indirect part can be extracted. In this work we show how knowledge of the direct and indirect parts of the solute-solvent PMF for water at the interface of a protein receptor can be used to gain insights about how to design tighter binding ligands. As we show, the indirect part of the solute-solvent PMF is equal to the sum of the 1-body (energy + entropy) terms in the inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) expansion of the solvation free energy. To illustrate the effect of displacing interfacial water molecules with particular direct/indirect PMF signatures on the binding of ligands, we carry out simulations of protein binding with several pairs of congeneric ligands. We show that interfacial water locations that contribute favorably or unfavorably at the 1-body level (energy + entropy) to the solvation free energy of the solute can be targeted as part of the ligand design process. Water locations where the indirect PMF is larger in magnitude provide better targets for displacement when adding a functional group to a ligand core.},

Considering the tremendous degree of success, including recognition by a 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are there still ``burning challenges'' in QM/MM methods, especially for biomolecular systems? In this short Perspective, we discuss several issues that we believe greatly impact the robustness and quantitative applicability of QM/MM simulations to many, if not all, biomolecules. We highlight these issues with observations and relevant advances from recent studies in our group and others in the field. Despite such limited scope, we hope the discussions are of general interest and will stimulate additional developments that help push the field forward in meaningful directions.},

GAtor is written in Python and currently interfaces with the FHI-aims code to perform local optimizations and energy evaluations using dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT). GAtor offers a variety of fitness evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation schemes. Breeding operators designed specifically for molecular crystals provide a balance between exploration and exploitation. Evolutionary niching is implemented in GAtor by using machine learning to cluster the dynamically updated population by structural similarity and then employing a cluster-based fitness function. Evolutionary niching promotes uniform sampling of the potential energy surface by evolving several subpopulations, which helps overcome initial pool biases and selection biases (genetic drift). The various settings offered by GAtor increase the likelihood of locating numerous low-energy minima, including those located in disconnected, hard to reach regions of the potential energy landscape. The best structures generated are re-relaxed and re-ranked using a hierarchy of increasingly accurate DFT functionals and dispersion methods. GAtor is applied to a chemically diverse set of four past blind test targets, characterized by different types of intermolecular interactions. The experimentally observed structures and other low-energy structures are found for all four targets. In particular, for Target II, 5-cyano-3-hydroxythiophene, the top ranked putative crystal structure is a Z{$\prime$} = 2 structure with P1symmetry and a scaffold packing motif, which has not been reported previously.}

We used an infrared probe to track the DFG motif of the mitotic kinase Aurora A (AurA) and found that allosteric activation by the spindle-associated protein Tpx2 involves an equilibrium shift toward the active DFG-in state. F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer experiments show that the activation loop undergoes a nanometer-scale movement that is tightly coupled to the DFG equilibrium. Tpx2 further activates AurA by stabilizing a water-mediated allosteric network that links the C-helix to the active site through an unusual polar residue in the regulatory spine. The polar spine residue and water network of AurA are essential for phosphorylation-driven activation, but an alternative form of the water network found in related kinases can support Tpx2-driven activation, suggesting that variations in the water-mediated hydrogen bond network mediate regulatory diversification in protein kinases.}

  abstract = {Dynamic properties are functionally important in many proteins, including the enzyme adenylate kinase (AK), for which the open/closed transition limits the rate of catalytic turnover. Here, we compare our previously published coarse-grained (double-well Go{\textasciimacron} ) simulation of mesophilic AK from E. coli (AKmeso) to simulations of thermophilic AK from Aquifex aeolicus (AKthermo). In AKthermo, as with AKmeso, the LID domain prefers to close before the NMP domain in the presence of ligand, but LID rigid-body flexibility in the open (O) ensemble decreases significantly. Backbone foldedness in O and/or transition state (TS) ensembles increases significantly relative to AKmeso in some interdomain backbone hinges and within LID. In contact space, the TS of AKthermo has fewer contacts at the CORE-LID interface but a stronger contact network surrounding the CORE-NMP interface than the TS of AKmeso. A ``heated'' simulation of AKthermo at 375K slightly increases LID rigid-body flexibility in accordance with the ``corresponding states'' hypothesis. Furthermore, while computational mutation of 7 prolines in AKthermo to their AKmeso counterparts produces similar small perturbations, mutation of these sites, especially positions 8 and 155, to glycine is required to achieve LID rigid-body flexibility and hinge flexibilities comparable to AKmeso. Mutating the 7 sites to proline in AKmeso reduces some hinges' flexibilities, especially hinge 2, but does not reduce LID rigid-body flexibility, suggesting that these two types of motion are decoupled in AKmeso. In conclusion, our results suggest that hinge flexibility and global functional motions alike are correlated with but not exclusively determined by the hinge residues. This mutational framework can inform the rational design of functionally important flexibility and allostery in other proteins toward engineering novel biochemical pathways.},

  abstract = {{$\beta$}-Lactamases are widespread in the bacterial world, where they are responsible for resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and related compounds, currently the most widely used antibacterial agents. Detailed structural and mechanistic understanding of these enzymes can be expected to guide the design of new antibacterial compounds resistant to their action. A number of high-resolution structures are available for class A {$\beta$}-lactamases, whose catalytic mechanism involves the acylation of a serine residue at the active site. The identity of the general base which participates in the activation of this serine residue during catalysis has been the subject of controversy, both a lysine residue and a glutamic acid residue having been proposed as candidates for this role. We have used the pH dependence of chemical modification of {$\varepsilon$}-amino groups by 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzenesulfonate and the pH dependence of the {$\varepsilon$}-methylene 1H and 13C chemical shifts (in enzyme selectively labeled with [{$\varepsilon$}-13C]lysine) to estimate the pK(a) of the relevant lysine residue, lysine-73, of TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase. Both methods show that the pK(a) of this residue is {$>$} 10, making it very unlikely that this residue could act as a proton acceptor in catalysis. An alternative mechanism in which this role is performed by glutamate-166 through an intervening water molecule is described.},

A smooth transition from cryogenic-like to solution phase properties can be obtained by using a combination of sol-gel encapsulation, addition of glycerol as a bathing medium, and temperature tuning (-15 --{$>$} 65 degrees C). This approach was applied to a series of double mutants, myoglobin CO (H64L/V68X, where X = Ala, Val, Leu, Asn, and Phe), which were designed to examine the contributions of the position 68(E11) side chain to the appearance and disappearance of internal rebinding phases in the absence of steric and polar interactions with the distal histidine. Based on the effects of viscosity, temperature, and the stereochemistry of the E11 side chain, the three major phases, B --{$>$} A, C --{$>$} A, and D --{$>$} A, can be assigned, respectively, to ligand rebinding from the following: (i) the distal heme pocket, (ii) the xenon cavities prior to large amplitude side chain conformational relaxation, and (iii) the xenon cavities after significant conformational relaxation of the position 68(E11) side chain. The relative amplitudes of the B --{$>$} A and C --{$>$} A phases depend markedly on the size and shape of the E11 side chain, which regulates sterically both ligand return to the heme iron atom and ligand migration to the xenon cavities. The internal xenon cavities provide a transient docking site that allows side chain relaxations and the entry of water into the vacated distal pocket, which in turn slows ligand recombination markedly.},

In one method, this force is replaced by a force with zero mean and {$\xi$} is advanced quasistatically. In the second method, the force is augmented adaptively by a biasing force.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo cardiac surgery appear to be at increased risk for the development of Nosocomial infections (NIs). The development of antibiotic-resistant infections has been associated with significantly greater hospital mortality rates compared to similar infections caused by antibiotic-sensitive pathogens.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is survey of Nis and antibiotic resistance patterns of causative bacteria among patients who underwent open heart surgery in the north of Iran during a 2-year period between September 2012 and September 2014.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional study we evaluated 187 patients that underwent open heart surgery with NIs. Demographic feature, clinical characteristics and risk factors of each infection were recorded. The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using the Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method according to the standard protocol of Clinical \& Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Detection of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria was performed by the double-disk synergy (DDS) test; also Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA) strains were identified by MRSA Screen Agar. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS software (ver. 16) and, descriptive statistics were used.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Out Of total of 2253 hospitalized patients who underwent open heart surgery, 187(5.05\%) patients had NIs. 51.9\% of the patients were female. The rates of surgical site infection (SSI), respiratory tract infection, endocarditis, Urinary tract infection (UTI), blood Infection and mediastinitis were 27.80, 25.66\%, 17.64, 17.11\% 8.55\% and 3.20\% respectively. E.coli and S.aureus were the most causative agents of NIs. The rate of ESBL-producing bacteria was 14.28- 71.42\% among enterobacteriaceae and the rate of MRSA was 54.2\% among S.aureus strains. All isolated Acinetobacter.spp were Multi-drug resistance (MDR).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: We showed that the rate of NIs among these high-risk patients was in the average level. But the emergence of MRSA and ESBL bacteria is increasing in our region.},

  abstract = {Epistasis is a key factor in evolution since it determines which combinations of mutations provide adaptive solutions and which mutational pathways toward these solutions are accessible by natural selection. There is growing evidence for the pervasiveness of sign epistasis - a complete reversion of mutational effects, particularly in protein evolution - yet its molecular basis remains poorly understood. We describe the structural basis of sign epistasis between G238S and R164S, two adaptive mutations in TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase - an enzyme that endows antibiotics resistance. Separated by 10 {\AA}, these mutations initiate two separate trajectories toward increased hydrolysis rates and resistance toward second and third-generation cephalosporins antibiotics. Both mutations allow the enzyme's active site to adopt alternative conformations and accommodate the new antibiotics. By solving the corresponding set of crystal structures, we found that R164S causes local disorder whereas G238S induces discrete conformations. When combined, the mutations in 238 and 164 induce local disorder whereby nonproductive conformations that perturb the enzyme's catalytic preorganization dominate. Specifically, Asn170 that coordinates the deacylating water molecule is misaligned, in both the free form and the inhibitor-bound double mutant. This local disorder is not restored by stabilizing global suppressor mutations and thus leads to an evolutionary cul-de-sac. Conformational dynamism therefore underlines the reshaping potential of protein's structures and functions but also limits protein evolvability because of the fragility of the interactions networks that maintain protein structures.},

  abstract = {Water oxygen-17 spin relaxation was used to study hydration and dynamics of the globular proteins bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and ubiquitin in aqueous solution. The frequency dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates was measured over the Larmor frequency range 2.6 to 49 MHz in the pD range 2 to 11 at 27 degrees C. While the protein-induced relaxation enhancement was similar for the two proteins at high frequencies, it was an order of magnitude smaller for ubiquitin than for BPTI at low frequencies. This difference was ascribed to the absence, in ubiquitin, of highly ordered internal water molecules, which are known to be present in BPTI and in most other globular proteins. These observations demonstrate that the water relaxation dispersion in protein solutions is essentially due to a few structural water molecules buried within the protein matrix, but exchanging rapidly with the external water. The relaxation data indicate that the internal water molecules of BPTI exchange with bulk water on the time-scale 10(-8) to 10(-6) second thus lowering the recently reported upper bound on the residence time of these internal water molecules by four orders of magnitude, and implying that local unfolding occurs on the submicrosecond time-scale. The water molecules residing at the surface of the two proteins were found to be highly mobile, with an average rotational correlation time of approximately 20 picoseconds. For both proteins, the oxygen-17 relaxation depended only very weakly on pD, showing that ionic residues do not perturb hydration water dynamics more than other surface residues. We believe that the present results resolve the long-standing controversy regarding the mechanism behind the spin relaxation dispersion of water nuclei in protein solutions, thus establishing oxygen-17 relaxation as a powerful tool for studies of structurally and functionally important water molecules in proteins and other biomolecules.},

Because this exchange is controlled by the protein structure, internal water molecules can be used to probe rare conformational fluctuations. Here, we report 2H and 17O MRD data at three temperatures for wild-type BPTI and two BPTI variants where the 14-38 disulfide bond has been cleaved by a double Cys {$\rightarrow$} Ser mutation or by disulfide reduction and carboxamido-methylation. The MRD data show that the internal water molecules are conserved on disulfide cleavage, However, the exchange rate of the water molecule buried near the disulfide bond is enhanced by 2-4 orders of magnitude. The relation of water exchange to other dynamic processes in BPTI is discussed.}

Herein, we further investigate the underlying mechanism of this conformational rearrangement and its implications for heme transfer via site-directed mutagenesis, resonance Raman (RR), hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS) methods, and molecular dynamics (MD). HDX-MS revealed that the apo-PhuS C-terminal {$\alpha$}6/{$\alpha$}7/{$\alpha$}8-helices are largely unstructured, whereas the apo-PhuS H212R variant showed an increase in structure within these regions. The increased rate of heme association with apo-PhuS H212R compared with the WT and lack of a detectable five-coordinate high-spin (5cHS) heme intermediate are consistent with a more folded and less dynamic C-terminal domain. HDX-MS and MD of holo-PhuS indicate an overall reduction in molecular flexibility throughout the protein, with significant structural rearrangement and protection of the heme binding pocket. We observed slow cooperative unfolding/folding events within the C-terminal helices of holo-PhuS and the N-terminal {$\alpha$}1/{$\alpha$}2-helices that are dampened or eliminated in the holo-PhuS H212R variant. Chemical cross-linking and MALDI-TOF MS mapped these same regions to the PhuS:HemO protein-protein interface. We previously proposed that the protein-protein interaction induces conformational rearrangement, promoting a ligand switch from His-209 to His-212 and triggering heme release to HemO. The reduced conformational freedom of holo-PhuS H212R combined with the increase in entropy and decrease in heme transfer on interaction with HemO further support this model. This study provides significant insight into the role of protein dynamics in heme binding and release in bacterial heme transport proteins.},

  abstract = {Protein conformation has been recognized as the key feature determining biological function, as it determines the position of the essential groups specifically interacting with substrates. Hence, the shape of the cavities or grooves at the protein surface appears to drive those functions. However, only a few studies describe the geometrical evolution of protein cavities during molecular dynamics simulations (MD), usually with a crude representation. To unveil the dynamics of cavity geometry evolution, we developed an approach combining cavity detection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This approach was applied to four systems subjected to MD (lysozyme, sperm whale myoglobin, Dengue envelope protein and EF-CaM complex). PCA on cavities allows us to perform efficient analysis and classification of the geometry diversity explored by a cavity. Additionally, it reveals correlations between the evolutions of the cavities and structures, and can even suggest how to modify the protein conformation to induce a given cavity geometry. It also helps to perform fast and consensual clustering of conformations according to cavity geometry. Finally, using this approach, we show that both carbon monoxide (CO) location and transfer among the different xenon sites of myoglobin are correlated with few cavity evolution modes of high amplitude. This correlation illustrates the link between ligand diffusion and the dynamic network of internal cavities.},

This method is an extension of that described by Kuntz et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 1982, 161, 269). The shape of a binding site on a macromolecular receptor is represented as a set of overlapping spheres. Each ligand is divided into a small set of large rigid fragments that are docked separately into the binding site and then rejoined later in the calculation. The division of ligands into separate fragments allows a degree of flexibility at the position that joins them. The rejoined fragments are then energy minimized in the receptor site. We illustrate the method with two test cases: dihydrofolate reductase/methotrexate and prealbumin/thyroxine. For each test case, the method finds binding geometries for the ligand near that observed crystallographically as well as others that provide good steric fit with the receptor. {\copyright} 1986, American Chemical Society.

The highest scoring orientations of known ligands resemble binding modes generated by interactive modeling or determined crystallographically. We describe the application of this procedure to the binding sites of papain and carbonic anhydrase.

Both the free form of the enzyme and its complex with benzylpenicillin were studied. During the simulation of the free enzyme, the conformation of the Omega loop and the interresidue contacts defining the complex H-bond network in the active site were quite stable. Most interestingly, the water molecule connecting Glu166 and Ser70 does not exchange with bulk solvent, emphasizing its structural and catalytic relevance. In the presence of the substrate, Ser130, Ser235, and Arg244 directly interact with the beta-lactam carboxylate via H-bonds, whereas the Lys234 ammonium group has only an electrostatic influence. These interactions together with other specific contacts result in a very short distance ( approximately 3 A) between the attacking hydroxyl group of Ser70 and the beta-lactam ring carbonyl group, which is a favorable orientation for nucleophilic attack. Our simulations also gave insight into the possible pathways for proton abstraction from the Ser70 hydroxyl group. We propose that either the Glu166 carboxylate-Wat1 or the substrate carboxylate-Ser130 moieties could abstract a proton from the nucleophilic Ser70.},

We show equilibration of structural kinetic transitions in the millisecond timescale during degradation of the two model substrates collagen and gelatin, which have different supersecondary structure and flexibility. Unexpectedly, the detected changes in collective enzyme-substrate-water-coupled motions persisted well beyond steady state for both substrates while displaying substrate-specific behaviors. Molecular dynamics simulations further showed that a hydration funnel (i.e., a gradient in retardation of hydrogen bond (HB) dynamics toward the active site) is substrate-dependent, exhibiting a steeper gradient for the more complex enzyme-collagen system. The long-lasting changes in protein-water dynamics reflect a collection of local energetic equilibrium states specifically formed during substrate conversion. Thus, the observed long-lasting water dynamics contribute to the net enzyme reactivity, impacting substrate binding, positional catalysis, and product release.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of {$\alpha$}-amylase inhibitors has been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and two analytical approaches, the Gaussian network model (GNM) and anisotropic network model (ANM). MD simulations use a full atomic approach with empirical force fields, while the analytical approaches are based on a coarse-grained single-site-per-residue model with a single- parameter harmonic potential between sufficiently close (r {$\leq$} 7 {\AA}) residue pairs. The major difference between the GNM and the ANM is that no directional preferences can be obtained in the GNM, all residue fluctuations being theoretically isotropic, while ANM does incorporate directional preferences. The dominant modes of motions are identified by (i) the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the MD trajectory matrices, and (ii) the similarity transformation of the Kirchhoff matrices of inter-residue contacts in the GNM or ANM. The mean-square fluctuations of individual residues and the cross-correlations between domain movements retain the same characteristics, in all approaches - although the dispersion of modes and detailed amplitudes of motion obtained in the ANM conform m more closely with MD results. The major weakness of the analytical approaches appears, on the other hand, to be their inadequacy to account for the anharmonic motions or multimeric transitions driven by the slowest collective mode observed in MD. Such motions usually suffer, however, from MD sampling inefficiencies, and multiple independent runs should be tested before malting conclusions about their validity and detailed mechanisms. Overall this study invites attention to (i) the robustness of the average properties (mean-square fluctuations, cross-correlations) controlled by the low frequency motions, which are invariably reproduced in all approaches, and (ii) the utility and efficiency of the ANM, the computational time cost of which is of the order of 'minutes' (real time), as opposed to 'days' for MD simulations.

Here, we simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts. The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location over 15 {\AA} from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.},

  abstract = {Structural fluctuations in proteins on the picosecond timescale have been studied in considerable detail by theoretical methods such as molecular dynamics simulation1,2, but there exist very few experimental data with which to test the conclusions. We have used the technique of inelastic neutron scattering to investigate atomic motion in hydrated myoglobin over the temperature range 4-350 K and on the molecular dynamics timescale 0.1-100 ps. At temperatures below 180 K myglobin behaves as a harmonic solid, with essentially only vibrational motion. Above 180 K there is a striking dynamic transition arising from the excitation of nonvibrational motion, which we interpret as corresponding to torsional jumps between states of different energy, with a mean energy asymmetry of kJ mol-1. This extra mobility is reflected in a strong temperature dependence of the mean-square atomic displacements, a phenomenon previously observed specifically for the heme iron by M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy3-5, but on a much slower timescale (10-7 s). It also correlates with a glass-like transition in the hydration shell of myoglobin6 and with the temperature-dependence of ligand-binding rates at the heme iron, as monitored by flash photolysis7. In contrast, the crystal structure of myoglobin determined down to 80 K shows no significant structural transition8-10. The dynamical behaviour we find for myoglobin (and other globular proteins) suggests a coupling of fast local motions to slower collective motions, which is a characteristic feature of other dense glass-forming systems. {\copyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.}

Minimum inhibitory concentrations were calculated for E. coli cells harboring each Y105X mutant in the presence of various penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. We found that only aromatic residues as well as asparagine replacements conferred high in vivo survival rates for all substrates tested. At position 105, the small residues alanine and glycine provide weak substrate discrimination as evidenced by the difference in benzylpenicillin hydrolysis relative to cephalothin, two typical penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. Kinetic analyses of mutants of interest revealed that the Y105X replacements have a greater effect on Km than k cat, highlighting the importance of Tyr-105 in substrate recognition. Finally, by performing a short molecular dynamics study on a restricted set of Y105X mutants of TEM-1, we found that the strong aromatic bias observed at position 105 in Class A {$\beta$}-lactamases is primarily defined by a structural requirement, selecting planar residues that form a stabilizing wall to the active site. The adopted conformation of residue 105 prevents detrimental steric interactions with the substrate molecule in the active site cavity and provides a rationalization for the strong aromatic bias found in nature at this position among Class A {$\beta$}-lactamases.}

To this day, a handful of enzyme systems has been shown to rely on essential residue motions for catalysis, but the generality of such phenomena remains to be elucidated. Using NMR spectroscopy, we investigated the electronic and dynamic effects of several mutations at position 105 in TEM-1 beta-lactamase, an enzyme responsible for antibiotic resistance. Even in absence of substrate, our results show that the number and magnitude of short and long range effects on (1)H-(15)N chemical shifts are correlated with the catalytic efficiencies of the various Y105X mutants investigated. In addition, (15)N relaxation experiments on mutant Y105D show that several active-site residues of TEM-1 display significantly altered motions on both picosecond-nanosecond and microsecond-millisecond time scales despite many being far away from the site of mutation. The altered motions among various active-site residues in mutant Y105D may account for the observed decrease in catalytic efficiency, therefore suggesting that short and long range residue motions could play an important catalytic role in TEM-1 beta-lactamase. These results support previous observations suggesting that internal motions play a role in promoting protein function.},

Unfortunately, the efficacy of these life-saving antibiotics is significantly threatened by bacterial beta-lactamases. beta-Lactamases are now responsible for resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. In order to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam) were introduced into clinical practice. These inhibitors greatly enhance the efficacy of their partner beta-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin) in the treatment of serious Enterobacteriaceae and penicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. However, selective pressure from excess antibiotic use accelerated the emergence of resistance to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Furthermore, the prevalence of clinically relevant beta-lactamases from other classes that are resistant to inhibition is rapidly increasing. There is an urgent need for effective inhibitors that can restore the activity of beta-lactams. Here, we review the catalytic mechanisms of each beta-lactamase class. We then discuss approaches for circumventing beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, including properties and characteristics of mechanism-based inactivators. We next highlight the mechanisms of action and salient clinical and microbiological features of beta-lactamase inhibitors. We also emphasize their therapeutic applications. We close by focusing on novel compounds and the chemical features of these agents that may contribute to a "second generation" of inhibitors. The goal for the next 3 decades will be to design inhibitors that will be effective for more than a single class of beta-lactamases},

On the basis of results from theoretical studies, it is believed that the observed preference is dictated by favorable peptide-solvent interactions, which are realized through formation of optimal hydrogen-bonding water bridges between peptide donor and acceptor groups. In the present study, we address this issue explicitly by analyzing the hydration structure and thermodynamics of 16 low-energy conformers of the alanine dipeptide (N-acetylalanine-N'-methylamide) in liquid water. Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble were performed under ambient conditions with all-atom OPLS parameters for the alanine dipeptide and the TIP5P model for water. We find that the number of hydrogen-bonded water molecules connecting the peptide group donor and acceptor atoms has no effect on the solvation thermodynamics. Instead, the latter are determined by the work done to fully hydrate the peptide. This work is minimal for conformations that are characterized by a minimal overlap of the primary hydration shells around the peptide donor and acceptor atoms. As a result, peptide-solvent interactions favor "compact" conformations that do not include PII-like geometries. Our main conclusion is that the experimentally observed preference for PII does not arise due to favorable direct interactions between the peptide and water molecules. Instead, the latter act to unmask underlying conformational preferences that are a consequence of minimizing intrapeptide steric conflicts.},

In this work, we demonstrate their potential utility using Monte Carlo sampling of side-chain torsional angles on a fixed backbone to quantify correlations amongst side-chain inter-rotameric motions. Results indicate that long-range correlations of side-chain fluctuations can arise independently from several different types of interactions: steric repulsions, implicit solvent interactions, or hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions. These robust correlations persist across the entire protein (up to 60 {\AA} in the case of calmodulin) and can propagate long-range changes in side-chain variability in response to single residue perturbations.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AdK) is a small, monomeric enzyme that synchronizes the catalytic step with the enzyme's conformational dynamics to optimize a phosphoryl transfer reaction and the subsequent release of the product. Guided by experimental measurements of low catalytic activity in seven single-point mutation AdK variants (K13Q, R36A, R88A, R123A, R156K, R167A, and D158A), we utilized classical mechanical simulations to probe mutant dynamics linked to product release, and quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical calculations to compute a free energy barrier for the catalytic event. The goal was to establish a mechanistic connection between the two activities. Our calculations of the free energy barriers in AdK variants were in line with those from experiments, and conformational dynamics consistently demonstrated an enhanced tendency toward enzyme opening. This indicates that the catalytic residues in the wild-type AdK serve a dual role in this enzyme's function-one to lower the energy barrier for the phosphoryl transfer reaction and another to delay enzyme opening, maintaining it in a catalytically active, closed conformation for long enough to enable the subsequent chemical step. Our study also discovers that while each catalytic residue individually contributes to facilitating the catalysis, R36, R123, R156, R167, and D158 are organized in a tightly coordinated interaction network and collectively modulate AdK's conformational transitions. Unlike the existing notion of product release being rate-limiting, our results suggest a mechanistic interconnection between the chemical step and the enzyme's conformational dynamics acting as the bottleneck of the catalytic process. Our results also suggest that the enzyme's active site has evolved to optimize the chemical reaction step while slowing down the overall opening dynamics of the enzyme.},

The coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. Fundamental questions of protein hydration include, how far out into the solvent does the influence of the biomolecule reach, how is the water affected, and how are the properties of the hydration water influenced by the separation between protein molecules in solution? We show here that Terahertz spectroscopy directly probes such solvation dynamics around proteins, and determines the width of the dynamical hydration layer. We also investigate the dependence of solvation dynamics on protein concentration. We observe an unexpected nonmonotonic trend in the measured terahertz absorbance of the five helix bundle protein lambda(6-85)* as a function of the protein: water molar ratio. The trend can be explained by overlapping solvation layers around the proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate water dynamics in the solvation layer around one protein to be distinct from bulk water out to approximately 10 A. At higher protein concentrations such that solvation layers overlap, the calculated absorption spectrum varies nonmonotonically, qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations. The experimental data suggest an influence on the correlated water network motion beyond 20 A, greater than the pure structural correlation length usually observed.},

  abstract = {Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the most promiscuous of the human CYP enzymes and contributes to the metabolism of {$\approx$}50\% of marketed drugs. It is also the isoform most often involved in unwanted drug-drug interactions. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing CYP3A4-ligand interaction therefore would be of great importance to any drug discovery effort. Here, we present crystal structures of human CYP3A4 in complex with two well characterized drugs: ketoconazole and erythromycin. In contrast to previous reports, the protein undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon ligand binding with an increase in the active site volume by {$>$}80\%. The structures represent two distinct open conformations of CYP3A4 because ketoconazole and erythromycin induce different types of coordinate shifts. The binding of two molecules of ketoconazole to the CYP3A4 active site and the clear indication of multiple binding modes for erythromycin has implications for the interpretation of the atypical kinetic data often displayed by CYP3A4. The extreme flexibility revealed by the present structures also challenges any attempt to apply computational design tools without the support of relevant experimental data. {\copyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenously produced gaseous second messenger capable of modulating many physiological processes, much like nitric oxide, prompted us to investigate the potential of H2S as a cardioprotective agent. In the current study, we demonstrate that the delivery of H2S at the time of reperfusion limits infarct size and preserves left ventricular (LV) function in an in vivo model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI-R). This observed cytoprotection is associated with an inhibition of myocardial inflammation and a preservation of both mitochondrial structure and function after I-R injury. Additionally, we show that modulation of endogenously produced H2S by cardiac-specific overexpression of cystathionine {$\gamma$}-lyase ({$\alpha$}-MHC-CGL-Tg mouse) significantly limits the extent of injury. These findings demonstrate that H2S may be of value in cytoprotection during the evolution of myocardial infarction and that either administration of H2S or the modulation of endogenous production may be of clinical benefit in ischemic disorders. {\copyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Trajectory snapshots were scanned for cavities on the protein surface using the program PASS. The detected cavities were clustered to determine several distinct transient pockets. They all opened within 2.5 ps, and most of them appeared multiple times. All three systems gave similar results overall. At the native binding site, pockets of similar size compared with a known inhibitor bound could be observed for all three systems. AutoDock could successfully place inhibitor molecules into these transient pockets with less than 2 {\AA} rms deviation from their crystal structures, suggesting this protocol as a viable tool to identify transient ligand binding pockets on protein surfaces. {\copyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.}

A previous study has suggested that increasing HuPON1's VX hydrolysis activity one to two orders of magnitude would make the enzyme an effective countermeasure for in vivo use against VX. This study helps facilitate further engineering of HuPON1 for enhanced VX-hydrolase activity by computationally characterizing HuPON1's tertiary structure and how HuPON1 binds VX. HuPON1's structure is first predicted through two homology modeling procedures. Docking is then performed using four separate methods, and the stability of each bound conformation is analyzed through molecular dynamics and solvated interaction energy calculations. The results show that VX's lone oxygen atom has a strong preference for forming a direct electrostatic interaction with HuPON1's active site calcium ion. Various HuPON1 residues are also detected that are in close proximity to VX and are therefore potential targets for future mutagenesis studies. These include E53, H115, N168, F222, N224, L240, D269, I291, F292, and V346. Additionally, D183 was found to have a predicted pKa near physiological pH. Given D183's location in HuPON1's active site, this residue could potentially act as a proton donor or accepter during hydrolysis. The results from the binding simulations also indicate that steered molecular dynamics can potentially be used to obtain accurate binding predictions even when starting with a closed conformation of a protein's binding or active site. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Here, the question is examined to what extent the conformational preferences in dipeptides reflect the backbone dynamics in polypeptides and proteins and to what extent an alanine dipeptide-based backbone torsion parametrization can lead to accurate reproduction of amino acid dependent {$\phi$}/{$\Psi$} preferences in protein structures. Results from a comparison of the analysis of Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures with long simulations of selected proteins and amino acid dipeptides suggest that a common alanine dipeptide-based torsion potential does in fact lead to excellent agreement between protein simulations and PDB structures. At the same time, the {$\phi$}/{$\Psi$} preferences in the dipeptides are significantly different, suggesting that dipeptides are not good model systems for studying protein backbone dynamics.},

Comparing protein processes with the dielectric fluctuations of the surrounding solvent shows that they fall into two classes: nonslaved and slaved. Nonslaved processes are independent of the solvent motions; their rates are determined by the protein conformation and vibrational dynamics. Slaved processes are tightly coupled to the solvent; their rates have approximately the same temperature dependence as the rate of the solvent fluctuations, but they are smaller. Because the temperature dependence is determined by the activation enthalpy, we propose that the solvent is responsible for the activation enthalpy, whereas the protein and the hydration shell control the activation entropy through the energy landscape. Bond formation is the prototype of nonslaved processes; opening and closing of channels are quintessential slaved motions. The prevalence of slaved motions highlights the importance of the environment in cells and membranes for the function of proteins.},

Molecular dynamics simulations and analytical models are used to access site-resolved information on hydration shell dynamics and to elucidate the molecular origins of the dynamical perturbation of hydration shell water relative to bulk water. We show that all four proteins have very similar hydration shell dynamics, despite their wide range of sizes and functions, and differing secondary structures. We demonstrate that this arises from the similar local surface topology and surface chemical composition of the four proteins, and that such local factors alone are sufficient to rationalize the hydration shell dynamics. We propose that these conclusions can be generalized to a wide range of globular proteins. We also show that protein conformational fluctuations induce a dynamical heterogeneity within the hydration layer. We finally address the effect of confinement on hydration shell dynamics via a site-resolved analysis and connect our results to experiments via the calculation of two-dimensional infrared spectra.},

The protein equilibrium fluctuations are investigated with Elastic Neutron Scattering using the spectrometer IN13 at ILL (Grenoble), while the relaxations of the protein + hydration water system are investigated with Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy; finally, Differential Scanning Calorimetry is used to obtain a thermodynamic description of the system. The effect of increasing hydration is to speed up the relaxations of the myoglobin + hydration water system and, thermodynamically, to decrease the glass transition temperature; these effects tend to saturate at h values greater than {$\sim$} 0.3. Moreover, the calorimetric scans put in evidence the occurrence of an endothermic peak whose onset temperature is located at {$\sim$} 230 K independent of hydration. From the point of view of the protein equilibrium fluctuations, while the amplitude of anharmonic mean square displacements is found to increase with hydration, their onset temperature (i.e. the onset temperature of the well known "protein dynamical transition") is hydration independent. On the basis of the above results, the relevance of protein + hydration water relaxations and of the thermodynamic state of hydration water to the onset of the protein dynamical transition is discussed. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Proteins, the workhorses of living systems, are constructed from chains of amino acids, which are synthesized in the cell based on the instructions of the genetic code and then folded into working proteins. The time for folding varies from microseconds to hours. What controls the folding rate is hotly debated. We postulate here that folding has the same temperature dependence as the {$\alpha$}-fluctuations in the bulk solvent but is much slower. We call this behavior slaving. Slaving has been observed in folded proteins: Large-scale protein motions follow the solvent fluctuations with rate coefficient k {$\alpha$} but can be slower by a large factor. Slowing occurs because large-scale motions proceed in many small steps, each determined by k {$\alpha$}. If conformational motions of folded proteins are slaved, so a fortiori must be the motions during folding. The unfolded protein makes a Brownian walk in the conformational space to the folded structure, with each step controlled by k{$\alpha$}. Because the number of conformational substates in the unfolded protein is extremely large, the folding rate coefficient, kf, is much smaller than k{$\alpha$}. The slaving model implies that the activation enthalpy of folding is dominated by the solvent, whereas the number of steps nf = k{$\alpha$}/ kf is controlled by the number of accessible substates in the unfolded protein and the solvent. Proteins, however, undergo not only {$\alpha$}- but also {$\beta$}-fluctuations. These additional fluctuations are local protein motions that are essentially independent of the bulk solvent fluctuations and may be relevant at late stages of folding.},

Here we report the 1.7-{\AA} resolution crystal structure of the cholesterol-binding protein deficient in this disease, NPC2, and the characterization of its ligand binding properties. Human NPC2 binds the cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol with submicromolar affinity at both acidic and neutral pH. NPC2 has an Ig-like fold stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The structure of the bovine protein reveals a loosely packed region penetrating from the surface into the hydrophobic core that forms adjacent small cavities with a total volume of {$\approx$}160 {\AA}3. We propose that this region represents the incipient cholesterol-binding site that dilates to accommodate an {$\approx$}740-{\AA}3 cholesterol molecule.}

  abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 {\AA} in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 {\AA} in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

We also introduce path-sampling algorithms, which can identify path-like CVs in a high-dimensional free-energy space. Machine-learning algorithms offer a viable approach to finding suitable CVs by analyzing trajectories from preliminary simulations. We discuss both the performance of machine-learning-derived CVs in enhanced-sampling simulations of experimental models and the challenges involved in applying these CVs to realistic, complex molecular assemblies. Moreover, we provide a prospective view of the potential advancements of machine-learning algorithms for the development of CVs in the field of enhanced-sampling simulations.},

  abstract = {Proper use of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) algorithm in free-energy calculations needs certain prerequisites to be met, namely, that the Jacobian for the metric transformation and its first derivative be available and the coarse variables be independent and fully decoupled from any holonomic constraint or geometric restraint, thereby limiting singularly the field of application of the approach. The extended ABF (eABF) algorithm circumvents these intrinsic limitations by applying the time-dependent bias onto a fictitious particle coupled to the coarse variable of interest by means of a stiff spring. However, with the current implementation of eABF in the popular molecular dynamics engine NAMD, a trajectory-based post-treatment is necessary to derive the underlying free-energy change. Usually, such a posthoc analysis leads to a decrease in the reliability of the free-energy estimates due to the inevitable loss of information, as well as to a drop in efficiency, which stems from substantial read-write accesses to file systems. We have developed a user-friendly, on-the-fly code for performing eABF simulations within NAMD. In the present contribution, this code is probed in eight illustrative examples. The performance of the algorithm is compared with traditional ABF, on the one hand, and the original eABF implementation combined with a posthoc analysis, on the other hand. Our results indicate that the on-the-fly eABF algorithm (i) supplies the correct free-energy landscape in those critical cases where the coarse variables at play are coupled to either each other or to geometric restraints or holonomic constraints, (ii) greatly improves the reliability of the free-energy change, compared to the outcome of a posthoc analysis, and (iii) represents a negligible additional computational effort compared to regular ABF. Moreover, in the proposed implementation, guidelines for choosing two parameters of the eABF algorithm, namely the stiffness of the spring and the mass of the fictitious particles, are proposed. The present on-the-fly eABF implementation can be viewed as the second generation of the ABF algorithm, expected to be widely utilized in the theoretical investigation of recognition and association phenomena relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract = {ConspectusThe observation of complex structural transitions in biological and abiological molecular objects within time scales amenable to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is often hampered by significant free energy barriers associated with entangled movements. Importance-sampling algorithms, a powerful class of numerical schemes for the investigation of rare events, have been widely used to extend simulations beyond the time scale common to MD. However, probing processes spanning milliseconds through microsecond molecular simulations still constitutes in practice a daunting challenge because of the difficulty of taming the ruggedness of multidimensional free energy surfaces by means of naive transition coordinates. To address this limitation, in recent years we have elaborated importance-sampling methods relying on an adaptive biasing force (ABF). In this Account, we review recent developments of algorithms aimed at mapping rugged free energy landscapes that correspond to complex processes of physical, chemical, and biological relevance. Through these developments, we have broadened the spectrum of applications of the popular ABF algorithm while improving its computational efficiency, notably for multidimensional free energy calculations. One major algorithmic advance, coined meta-eABF, merges the key features of metadynamics and an extended Lagrangian variant of ABF (eABF) by simultaneously shaving the barriers and flooding the valleys of the free energy landscape, and it possesses a convergence rate up to 5-fold greater than those of other importance-sampling algorithms. Through faster convergence and enhanced ergodic properties, meta-eABF represents a significant step forward in the simulation of millisecond-time-scale events. Here we introduce extensions of the algorithm, notably its well-tempered and replica-exchange variants, which further boost the sampling efficiency while gaining in numerical stability, thus allowing quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical free energy calculations to be performed at a lower cost.

The effect of transient H-bonds and transient broken H-bonds on H-bond lifetimes is further investigated, and results are compared with depolarized Rayleigh scattering lifetimes for neat water. A significant electrostriction is observed in the first hydration shell of Li(+) and F(-), while larger ions cause a small expansion of the H-bond network of water instead. However, both alkali cations and halide anions induce a minor contraction of the H-bond network in the second hydration shell. Further, water in the second hydration shell of Li(+), Na(+), and K(+) is less tetrahedral than neat water, resembling water at high pressures, while the H-bond network in the respective hydration shell of halide anions resembles water at low temperatures. Nevertheless, neither ion induced H-bond contraction nor expansion can be exactly mapped onto P or T effects on the local structure of water. Even though the average number and lifetime of H-bonds in the ionic hydration shells of most ions are not very different from those found in neat water, Li(+) and F(-) significantly increase the lifetime of water donor and acceptor H-bonds, respectively, in the first hydration shell. The non-monotonic increase of cation and anion mobility, with ionic size, observed experimentally, is interpreted in terms of the water local tetrahedrality around cations and anions.},

The present work utilizes site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to characterize flap conformations in HIV-1 protease in an inhibited and uninhibited form. Because HIV protease is a homodimer, incorporation of the labeling probe at K55C yields a spin label pair within the protease, suitable for distance measurements by pulsed techniques. DEER experiments were performed with and without protease inhibitors to determine distances between residues 55-55- within the flap region of the protease. Analysis of the EPR results demonstrates that the flap region spans a continuous, rather than segmental, range of motion in its uninhibited state. Upon addition of inhibitor, the distance between spin labels shortens by-3-4 {\AA} (regardless of spin label choice), indicating a closing of the flaps. More importantly, these results characterize the range of flap opening in an uninhibited form, showing distances that span 26-48 {\AA}, indicative of a broad range of possible conformations.

We find that an atom on the protein surface occupies, on average, a volume {$\simeq$}7\% larger than an atom of equivalent chemical type in the protein core. In these calculations, larger volumes result from voids between atoms and thus imply a looser or less efficient packing. We further find that the volumes of individual atoms are not related to their chemical type but rather to their structural location. More exposed atoms have larger volumes. Moreover, the packing around atoms in locally concave, grooved regions of protein surfaces is looser than that around atoms in locally convex, ridge regions. This as a direct manifestation of surface curvature-dependent hydration. The net volume increase for atoms on the protein surface is compensated by volume decreases in water molecules near the surface. These waters occupy volumes smaller than those in the bulk solvent by up to 20\%; the precise amount of this decrease is directly related to the extent of contact with the protein.},

Chem. Phys. 2007, 126 (22), 224102.]. It is based on the introduction of blocks, consisting of groups of atoms, that can move as rigid bodies. The internai geometry of the blocks need not correspond to an overall optimization state of the total molecular structure. The standard MBH approach considers free blocks with six degrees of freedom. In the extended MBH approach introduced herein, the blocks can be connected by one or two adjoining atoms, which further reduces the number of degrees of freedom. The new approach paves the way for the normal-mode analysis of biomolecules such as proteins. It rests on the hypothesis that low-frequency modes of proteins can be described as pure rigid-body motions of blocks of consecutive amino acid residues. The method is validated for a series of small molecules and further applied to alanine dipeptide as a prototype to describe vibrational interactions between two peptide units; to crambin, a small protein with 46 amino acid residues; and to ICE/caspase-1, which contains 518 amino acid residues. {\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.}

Several partial Hessian methods have been proposed in the literature, yielding approximate normal modes. These methods aim at reducing the computational load and/or calculating only the relevant normal modes of interest in a specific application. Each method has its own (dis)advantages and application field but guidelines for the most suitable choice are lacking. We have investigated several partial Hessian methods, including the Partial Hessian Vibrational Analysis (PHVA), the Mobile Block Hessian (MBH), and the Vibrational Subsystem Analysis (VSA). In this article, we focus on the benefits and drawbacks of these methods, in terms of the reproduction of localized modes, collective modes, and the performance in partially optimized structures. We find that the PHVA is suitable for describing localized modes, that the MBH not only reproduces localized and global modes but also serves as an analysis tool of the spectrum, and that the VSA is mostly useful for the reproduction of the low frequency spectrum. These guidelines are illustrated with the reproduction of the localized amine-stretch, the spectrum of quinine and a bis-cinchona derivative, and the low frequency modes of the LAO binding protein. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The calculation of the analytical second derivative matrix (Hessian) is the bottleneck for vibrational analysis in QM/MM systems when an electrostatic embedding scheme is employed. Even with a small number of QM atoms in the system, the presence of MM atoms increases the computational cost dramatically: the long-range Coulomb interactions require that additional coupled perturbed self-consistent field (CPSCF) equations need to be solved for each MM atom displacement. This paper presents an extension to the Mobile Block Hessian (MBH) formalism for QM/MM calculations with blocks in the MM region and its implementation in a parallel version of the Q-Chem/CHARMM interface. MBH reduces both the CPU time and the memory requirements compared to the standard full Hessian QM/MM analysis, without the need to use a cutoff distance for the electrostatic interactions. Special attention is given to the treatment of link atoms which are usually present when the QM/MM border cuts through a covalent bond. Computational efficiency improvements are highlighted using a reduced chorismate mutase enzyme system, consisting of 24 QM atoms and 306 MM atoms, as a test example. In addition, the drug bortezomib, used for cancer treatment of myeloma, has been studied as a test case with multiple MBH block choices and both a QM and QM/MM description. The accuracy of the calculated Hessians is quantified by imposing Eckart constraints, which allows for the assessment of numerical errors in second derivative procedures. The results show that MBH within the QM/MM description not only is a computationally attractive method but also produces accurate results. {\copyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Dengue virus poses a significant global health threat as the source of increasingly deleterious dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. As no specific antiviral treatment exists for dengue infection, considerable effort is being applied to discover therapies and drugs for maintenance and prevention of these afflictions. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, and infection occurs following viral endocytosis by host cells. Upon entering the cell, viral RNA is translated into a large multisubunit polyprotein which is post-translationally cleaved into mature, structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. The viral genome encodes the enzyme to carry out cleavage of the large polyprotein, specifically the NS2B-NS3pro cofactor-protease complex---a target of high interest for drug design. One class of recently discovered NS2B-NS3pro inhibitors is the substrate-based trifluoromethyl ketone containing peptides. These compounds interact covalently with the active site Ser135 via a hemiketal adduct. A detailed picture of the intermolecular protease/inhibitor interactions of the hemiketal adduct is crucial for rational drug design. We demonstrate, through the use of protein- and ligand-detected solution-state \textsuperscript{19}F and \textsuperscript{1}H NMR methods, an unanticipated multibinding mode behavior of a representative of this class of inhibitors to dengue NS2B-NS3pro. Our results illustrate the highly dynamic nature of both the covalently bound ligand and protease protein structure, and the need to consider these dynamics when designing future inhibitors in this class.},

With modern drug-design approaches relying heavily on the elucidation of atomic interactions of potential new drugs with their targets, the need for co-crystal structures with the compounds of interest is high. DXS itself is a promising drug target, as it catalyzes the first reaction in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)-pathway for the biosynthesis of the universal precursors of terpenes, which are essential secondary metabolites. In contrast to many bacteria and pathogens, which employ the MEP pathway, mammals use the distinct mevalonate-pathway for the biosynthesis of these precursors, which makes all enzymes of the MEP-pathway potential new targets for the development of anti-infectives. However, crystallization of DXS has proven to be challenging: while the first X-ray structures from Escherichia coli and D. radiodurans were solved in 2004, since then only two additions have been made in 2019 that were obtained under anoxic conditions. The presented site of truncation can potentially also be transferred to other homologues, opening up the possibility for the determination of crystal structures from pathogenic species, which until now could not be crystallized. This manuscript also provides a further example that truncation of a variable region of a protein can lead to improved structural data.},

Using this method, free-energy barriers of individual collective variables are significantly reduced compared with simple force-field scaling. The introduced methodology is flexible and allows adaptive bias potentials to be self-consistently constructed for a large number of simple collective variables, such as distances and dihedral angles.

The asymmetry of the measure allows feedback evaluations. In particular, this tool has potential applications in investigating windows of temporal integration and stimulus-induced modulation of firing rate. Transfer entropy is also able to eliminate some effects of common history in spike trains and obtains results that are different from cross-correlation. The basic transfer entropy properties are illustrated with simulations. The information transfer through a network of 16 simultaneous multiunit recordings in cat's auditory cortex was examined for a large number of acoustic stimulus types. Application of the transfer entropy to a large database of multiple single-unit activity in cat's primary auditory cortex revealed that most windows of temporal integration found during spontaneous activity range between 2 and 15 ms. The normalized transfer entropy shows similarities and differences with the strength of cross-correlation; these form the basis for revisiting the neural assembly concept.

The rczz CPMG experiment (Wang, C.; Grey, M. J.; Palmer, A. G. J. Biomol. NMR 2001, 21, 361-366) is used to record (15)N spin relaxation dispersion data, R(ex)(1/tau(cp)), in which 1/tau(cp) is the pulsing rate in the CPMG sequence, at two static magnetic fields, 11.7 and 14.1 T, and three temperatures, 280, 290, and 300 K. These data are used to characterize the kinetics and mechanism of chemical exchange line broadening of the backbone (15)N spins of Cys 14, Lys 15, Cys 38, and Arg 39 in BPTI. Line broadening is found to result from two processes: the previously identified isomerization of the Cys 38 side chain between chi(1) rotamers (Otting, G.; Liepinsh, E.; W{\"u}thrich, K. Biochemistry 1993, 32, 3571-3582) and a previously uncharacterized process on a faster time scale. At 300 K, both processes contribute significantly to the relaxation dispersion for Cys 14 and an analytical expression for a linear three-site exchange model is used to analyze the data. At 280 K, isomerization of the Cys 38 side chain is negligibly slow and the faster process dominates the relaxation dispersion for all four spins. Global analysis of the temperature and static field dependence of R(ex)(1/tau(cp)) for Cys 14 and Lys 15 is used to determine the activation parameters and chemical shift changes for the previously uncharacterized chemical exchange process. Through an analysis of a database of chemical shifts, (15)N chemical shift changes for Cys 14 and Lys 15 are interpreted to result from a chi(1) rotamer transition of Cys 14 that converts the Cys 14-Cys 38 disulfide bond between right- and left-handed conformations. At 290 K, isomerization of Cys 14 occurs with a forward and reverse rate constant of 35 s(-1) and 2500 s(-1), respectively, a time scale more than 30-fold faster than the Cys 38 chi(1) isomerization. A comparison of the kinetics and thermodynamics for the transitions between the two alternative Cys 14-Cys 38 conformations highlights the factors that affect the contribution of disulfide bonds to protein stability.},

Previously, rational genetic engineering produced OPH variants with 30-fold enhancements in the hydrolysis of CWA and their analogs. One interesting variant (H254R) in which the histidine at position 254 was changed to an arginine showed a 4-fold increase in the hydrolysis of demetonS (VX analog), a 14-fold decrease with paraoxon (an insecticide), and a 183-fold decrease with DFP (sarin analog). The three-dimensional structure of this enzyme at 1.9 {\AA} resolution with the inhibitor, diethyl 4-methylbenzylphosphonate (EBP), revealed that the inhibitor did not bind at the active site, but bound exclusively into a well-defined surface pocket 12 A away from the active site. This structural feature was accompanied by non-competitive inhibition of paraoxon hydrolysis by EBP with H254R, in contrast to the native enzyme, which showed competitive inhibition. These parallel structure-function characteristics identify a functional, allosteric site on the surface of this enzyme. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

These changes were tightly correlated with rearrangements at the active site during the formation of productive enzyme-substrate intermediates and were different from those in an enzyme-inhibitor complex. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a steep gradient of fast-to-slow coupled protein-water motions around the protein, active site and substrate. Our results show that water retardation occurs before formation of the functional Michaelis complex. We propose that the observed gradient of coupled protein-water motions may assist enzyme-substrate interactions through water-polarizing mechanisms that are remotely mediated by the catalytic metal ion and the enzyme active site.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of standard binding free energies describing protein:ligand association remains a daunting computational endeavor. This challenge is rooted to a large extent in the considerable changes in conformational, translational and rotational entropies underlying the binding process that atomistic simulations cannot easily capture. In spite of significant methodological advances, reflected in a continuously improving agreement with experiment, a characterization of alternate strategies aimed at measuring binding affinities, notably their respective advantages and drawbacks, is somewhat lacking. Here, two distinct avenues to determine the standard binding free energy are compared in the case of a short, proline-rich peptide associating to the Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinase Abl. These avenues - one relying upon alchemical transformations and the other on potentials of mean force (PMFs) - invoke a series of geometrical restraints acting on collective variables designed to alleviate sampling limitations inherent to classical molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental binding free energy of \${$\Delta\$$}G bind = -7.99 kcal/mol is well reproduced by the two strategies developed herein, with \${$\Delta\$$}G bind = -7.7 for the alchemical route and \${$\Delta\$$}G bind = -7.8 kcal/mol for the alternate PMF-based route. In detailing the underpinnings of these numerical strategies devised for the accurate determination of standard binding free energies, many practical elements of the proposed rigorous, conceptual framework are clarified, thereby paving way to tackle virtually any recognition and association phenomenon.},

The method is general and can be combined with other advanced sampling techniques. In the particular implementation proposed here, it is illustrated in the context of an adaptive biasing force approach where, rather than relying on discrete force estimates, one can resort to a self-regularizing artificial neural network to generate continuous, estimated generalized forces. By doing so, the proposed approach addresses several shortcomings common to adaptive biasing force and other algorithms. Specifically, the neural network enables (1) smooth estimates of generalized forces in sparsely sampled regions, (2) force estimates in previously unexplored regions, and (3) continuous force estimates with which to bias the simulation, as opposed to biases generated at specific points of a discrete grid. The usefulness of the method is illustrated with three different examples, chosen to highlight the wide range of applicability of the underlying concepts. In all three cases, the new method is found to enhance considerably the underlying traditional adaptive biasing force approach. The method is also found to provide improvements over previous implementations of neural network assisted algorithms.},

Current computational fragment-based approaches circumvent these issues but suffer from limited representations of protein flexibility and solvation effects, leading to difficulties with rigorous ranking of fragment affinities. To overcome these limitations we describe an explicit solvent all-atom molecular dynamics methodology (SILCS: Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation) that uses small aliphatic and aromatic molecules plus water molecules to map the affinity pattern of a protein for hydrophobic groups, aromatic groups, hydrogen bond donors, and hydrogen bond acceptors. By simultaneously incorporating ligands representative of all these functionalities, the method is an in silico free energy-based competition assay that generates three-dimensional probability maps of fragment binding (FragMaps) indicating favorable fragment:protein interactions. Applied to the two-fold symmetric oncoprotein BCL-6, the SILCS method yields two-fold symmetric FragMaps that recapitulate the crystallographic binding modes of the SMRT and BCOR peptides. These FragMaps account both for important sequence and structure differences in the C-terminal halves of the two peptides and also the high mobility of the BCL-6 His116 sidechain in the peptide-binding groove. Such SILCS FragMaps can be used to qualitatively inform the design of small-molecule inhibitors or as scoring grids for high-throughput in silico docking that incorporate both an atomic-level description of solvation and protein flexibility. {\copyright} 2009 Guvench, MacKerell.},

We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture, DeepMBS, to predict protein metal binding sites. To our knowledge, this study is the first realization of deep learning idea for the problem of predicting metal binding site. The method allows automatic extraction of complex interactions between important features using only sequence information by utilizing PAM120 scoring matrix. Features were extracted from protein sequences obtained from the Protein Data Bank and deep convolutional neural network was applied to these features. According to experimental results on a benchmark dataset, metal binding states can be predicted with 82\% recall and 79\% precision.

Protein hydration - the perturbation of water structure and dynamics by the protein surface - has been a particularly rich source of controversy and confusion. Our aim here is to critically examine central concepts in the description of protein hydration, and to assess the experimental basis for the current view of protein hydration, with the focus on dynamic aspects. Recent oxygen-17 magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments have shown that the vast majority of water molecules in the protein hydration layer suffer a mere twofold dynamic retardation compared with bulk water. The high mobility of hydration water ensures that all thermally activated processes at the protein-water interface, such as binding, recognition and catalysis, can proceed at high rates. The MRD-derived picture of a highly mobile hydration layer is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but is incompatible with results deduced from intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is also inconsistent with the common view of hydration effects on protein hydrodynamics. Here, we show how these discrepancies can be resolved.},

  abstract = {Localized water molecules in the binding pockets of proteins play an important role in noncovalent association of proteins and small drug compounds. At times, the dominant contribution to the binding free energy comes from the release of localized water molecules in the binding pockets of biomolecules. Therefore, to quantify the energetic importance of these water molecules for drug design purposes, we have used the double-decoupling approach to calculate the standard free energy of tying up a water molecule in the binding pockets of two protein complexes. The double-decoupling approach is based on the underlying principle of statistical thermodynamics. We have calculated the standard free energies of tying up the water molecule in the binding pockets of these complexes to be favorable. These water molecules stabilize the protein-drug complexes by interacting with the ligands and binding pockets. Our results offer ideas that could be used in optimizing protein-drug interactions, by designing ligands that are capable of targeting localized water molecules in protein binding sites. The resulting free energy of ligand binding could benefit from the potential free energy gain accompanying the release of these water molecules. Furthermore, we have examined the theoretical background of the double-decoupling method and its connection to the molecular dynamics thermodynamic integration techniques.}

The backbone dynamics of the coagulation serine protease, apo-thrombin (S195M-thrombin), were compared to the substrate-bound form (PPACK-thrombin). R 1, R 2, 15 N-\{ 1 H\}NOEs, and relaxation dispersion NMR experiments were measured to capture motions across the ps to ms timescale. The ps-ns motions were not significantly altered upon substrate binding. The relaxation dispersion data revealed that apo-thrombin is highly dynamic, with {$\mu$}s-ms motions throughout the molecule. The region around the N-terminus of the heavy chain, the Na + -binding loop, and the 170 s loop, all of which are implicated in allosteric coupling between effector binding sites and the active site, were dynamic primarily in the apo-form. Most of the loops surrounding the active site become more ordered upon PPACK-binding, but residues in the N-terminal part of the heavy chain, the {$\gamma$}-loop, and anion-binding exosite 1, the main allosteric binding site, retain {$\mu$}s-ms motions. These residues form a dynamic allosteric pathway connecting the active site to the main allosteric site that remains in the substrate-bound form.}

Previous studies have shown that backbone amide groups within the trypsin-binding region of the wild-type protein undergo conformational exchange processes on the {$\mu$}s time scale, and that replacement of Tyr35 with Gly greatly increases the number of backbone atoms involved in such motions. In order to determine whether these mutational effects are specific to the replacement of this residue with Gly, six additional replacements were examined in the present study. In two of these, Tyr35 was replaced with either Ala or Leu, and the other four were single replacements of Tyr23, Phe33, Asn43 or Asn44, all of which are highly buried in the native structure and conserved in homologous proteins. The Y35A and Y35L mutants displayed dynamic properties very similar to those of the Y35G mutant, with the backbone segments including residues 10-19 and 32-44 undergoing motions revealed by enhanced15N transverse relaxation rates. On the other hand, the Y23L, N43G and N44A substitutions caused almost no detectable changes in backbone dynamics, on either the ns-ps or ms-{$\mu$}s time scales, even though each of these replacements significantly destabilizes the native conformation. Replacement of Phe33 with Leu caused intermediate effects, with several residues that have previously been implicated in motions in the wild-type protein displaying enhanced transverse relaxation rates. These results demonstrate that destabilizing amino acid replacements can be accommodated in a native protein with dramatically different effects on conformational dynamics and that Tyr35 plays a particularly important role in defining the conformation of the trypsin-binding site of BPTI. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The Tyr35 {$\rightarrow$} Gly replacement in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has previously been shown to dramatically enhance the flexibility of the trypsin-binding region of the free inhibitor and to destabilize the interaction with the protease by about 3~kcal/mol. The effects of this replacement on the enzyme-inhibitor interaction were further studied here by X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The co-crystal structure of Y35G BPTI bound to trypsin was determined using 1.65~{\AA} resolution X-ray diffraction data collected from cryopreserved crystals, and a new structure of the complex with wild-type BPTI under the same conditions was determined using 1.62~{\AA} data. These structures reveal that, in contrast to the free protein, Y35G BPTI adopts a conformation nearly identical with that of the wild-type protein, with a water-filled cavity in place of the missing Tyr side-chain. The crystallographic temperature factors for the two complexes indicate that the mutant inhibitor is nearly as rigid as the wild-type protein when bound to trypsin. Calorimetric measurements show that the change in enthalpy upon dissociation of the complex is 2.5~kcal/mol less favorable for the complex containing Y35G BPTI than for the complex with the wild-type inhibitor. Thus, the destabilization of the complex resulting from the Y35G replacement is due to a more favorable change in entropy upon dissociation. The heat capacity changes for dissociation of the mutant and wild-type complexes were very similar, suggesting that the entropic effects probably do not arise from solvation effects, but are more likely due to an increase in protein conformational entropy upon dissociation of the mutant inhibitor. These results define the biophysical role of a highly conserved core residue located outside of a protein-binding interface, demonstrating that Tyr35 has little impact on the trypsin-bound BPTI structure and acts primarily to define the structure of the free protein so as to maximize binding affinity. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally it has been difficult to identify and characterize novel allosteric sites and ligands that freeze these conformational states. We present a site-directed approach using Tethering for trapping inhibitory small molecules at sites away from the active site by reversible disulfide bond formation. We screened a library of 10,000 thiol-containing compounds against accessible cysteines of two members of the caspase family of proteases, caspase-3 and -7. We discovered a previously unreported and conserved allosteric site in a deep cavity at the dimer interface 14 A from the active site. This site contains a natural cysteine that, when disulfide-bonded with either of two specific compounds, inactivates these proteases. The allosteric site is functionally coupled to the active site, such that binding of the compounds at the allosteric site prevents peptide binding at the active site. The x-ray crystal structures of caspase-7 bound by either compound demonstrates that they inhibit caspase-7 by trapping a zymogen-like conformation. This approach may be useful to identify new allosteric sites from natural or engineered cysteines, to study allosteric transitions in proteins, and to nucleate drug discovery efforts.},

ALA uptake and light irradiation of PPIX produced by host cells leads to the inactivation of other parasites, along with some viruses, via the induction of an immune response. ALA-mediated PPIX production by host cells and light irradiation result in the inactivation of other viruses via either the induction of a host cell response or direct photodynamic attack on viral particles. This ALA- mediated production of light-activated PPIX has been extensively used as a form of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and has shown varying levels of efficacy in treating conditions that are associated with microbial infection, ranging from acne and verrucae to leishmaniasis and onychomycosis. However, for the treatment of some of these conditions by ALA-based PDT, the role of an antimicrobial effect has been disputed and in general, the mechanisms by which the technique inactivates microbes are not well understood. In this study, we review current understanding of the antimicrobial mechanisms used by ALA-based PDT and its role in the treatment of microbial infections along with its potential medical and nonmedical applications.},

We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique, called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts TEM specificity by accounting for conformational heterogeneity. Using our MSMs, we identify hidden states whose populations correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models' prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced {\textohm}-loop flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in drug and protein design.},

Despite growing interest in allosteric drug discovery, rational design is limited by a lack of sufficient structural information about alternative binding sites in proteins. Previously, we used Markov State Models (MSMs) to identify such acryptic pockets,o and here we describe a method for identifying compounds that bind in these cryptic pockets and modulate enzyme activity. Experimental tests validate our approach by revealing both an inhibitor and two activators of TEM {$\beta$}-lactamase (TEM). To identify hits, a library of compounds is first virtually screened against either the crystal structure of a known cryptic pocket or an ensemble of structures containing the same cryptic pocket that is extracted from an MSM. Hit compounds are then screened experimentally and characterized kinetically in individual assays. We identify three hits, one inhibitor and two activators, demonstrating that screening for binding to allosteric sites can result in both positive and negative modulation. The hit compounds have modest effects on TEM activity, but all have higher affinities than previously identified inhibitors, which bind the same cryptic pocket but were found, by chance, via a computational screen targeting the active site. Sitedirected mutagenesis of key contact residues predicted by the docking models is used to confirm that the compounds bind in the cryptic pocket as intended. Because hit compounds are identified from docking against both the crystal structure and structures from the MSM, this platform should prove suitable for many proteins, particularly targets whose crystal structures lack obvious druggable pockets, and for identifying both inhibitory and activating small-molecule modulators.},

GaMD enhances sampling and retrieves free energy information for biomolecular systems by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth the potential energy surface without the need for predefined reaction coordinates. Our innovative approach advances the acceleration power and energetic reweighting accuracy of GaMD by incorporating a replica exchange algorithm that enables the exchange of multiple parameters, including the GaMD boost parameters of force constant and energy threshold, as well as temperature. Applying MP-Rex-GaMD to the three model systems of dialanine, chignolin, and HIV protease, we demonstrate its superior capability over conventional molecular dynamics and GaMD simulations in exploring protein conformations and effectively navigating various biomolecular states across energy barriers. MP-Rex-GaMD allows users to accurately map free energy landscapes through energetic reweighting, capturing the ensemble of biomolecular states from low-energy conformations to rare high-energy transitions within practical computational time scales.}

An anharmonicity factor is defined which measures the degree of anharmonicity in the modes, be they principal modes or normal modes, and it is shown that the principal mode system naturally divides into anharmonic modes with peak frequencies below 80 cm-1, and harmonic modes with frequencies above this value. In general the larger the mean-square fluctuation of a principal mode, the greater the degree of anharmonicity in its motion. The anharmonic modes represent only 12\% of the total number of variables, but account for 98\% of the total mean-square fluctuation. The transitional nature of the anharmonic motion is demonstrated. The results strongly suggest that in a large subspace, the free energy surface, as probed by the simulation, is approximated by a multi-dimensional parabola which is just a rescaled version of the parabola corresponding to the harmonic approximation to the conformational energy surface at a single minimum. After 200 ps, the rescaling factor, termed the "normal mode rescaling factor," has apparently converged to a value whereby the mean-square fluctuation within the subspace is about twice that predicted by the normal mode analysis.},

LIGSITE is therefore well suited for identification of pockets in large sets of proteins (e.g., protein families) for comparative studies.

Geometric methods to identify pockets on protein surfaces have been developed over many years but, with new algorithms, their performance is still improving. Simulation methods show promise in accounting for protein conformational variability to identify transient pockets but lack the ease of use of many of the (rigid) shape-based tools. Sequence and structure comparison approaches are benefiting from the constantly increasing size of sequence and structure databases. Energetic methods can aid identification and characterization of binding pockets, and have undergone recent improvements in the treatment of solvation and hydrophobicity. The "druggability" of a binding site is still difficult to predict with an automated procedure. The methodologies available for this purpose range from simple shape and hydrophobicity scores to computationally demanding free energy simulations. {\copyright} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein energy landscapes.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate--enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent `closed' state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.},

A problem with this analysis is that random diffusion can appear as correlated motion. An analysis is presented of how long a simulation should be to obtain relevant results for global motions.

  abstract = {Solvation of molecules in water is at the heart of a myriad of molecular phenomena and of crucial importance to understanding such diverse issues as chemical reactivity or biomolecular function. Complementing well-established approaches, it has been shown that laser spectroscopy in the THz frequency domain offers new insights into hydration from small solutes to proteins. Upon introducing spatially-resolved analyses of the absorption cross section by simulations, the sensitivity of THz spectroscopy is traced back to characteristic distance-dependent modulations of absorption intensities for bulk water. The prominent peak at approximate to 200 cm(-1) is dominated by first-shell dynamics, whereas a concerted motion involving the second solvation shell contributes most significantly to the absorption at about 80 cm(-1) approximate to 2.4 THz. The latter can be understood in terms of an umbrella-like motion of two hydrogen-bonded tetrahedra along the connecting hydrogen bond axis. Thus, a modification of the hydrogen bond network, e. g., due to the presence of a solute, is expected to affect vibrational motion and THz absorption intensity at least on a length scale that corresponds to two layers of solvating water molecules. This result provides a molecular mechanism explaining the experimentally determined sensitivity of absorption changes in the THz domain in terms of distinct, solute-induced dynamical properties in solvation shells of (bio)molecules-even in the absence of well-defined resonances.},

In spite of individual successes in understanding the structural determinants of allostery in well-documented systems, much less success has been achieved in identifying a set of quantitative and transferable ground rules that provide an understanding of how allostery works. Are there organizing principles that allow us to relate structurally different proteins, or are the determinants of allostery unique to each system? Using an ensemble-based model, we show that allosteric phenomena can be formulated in terms of conformational free energies of the cooperative elements in a protein and the coupling interactions between them. Interestingly, the resulting allosteric ground rules provide a framework to reconcile observations that challenge purely structural models of site-to-site coupling, including (a) allostery in the absence of pathways of structural distortions, (b) allostery in the absence of any structural change, and (c) the ability of allosteric ligands to act as agonists under some circumstances and antagonists under others. The ensemble view of allostery that emerges provides insights into the energetic prerequisites of site-to-site coupling and thus into how allostery works. {\copyright} 2012 by Annual Reviews.

The new theoretical concept views the unfolding and refolding processes of protein as a shift of the structural distribution induced by a thermodynamic perturbation, with the variance-covariance matrix varying. Based on the theoretical concept, a method to characterize the mechanism of folding (or unfolding) is proposed. The transition state, if any, between two stable states is interpreted as a gap in the distribution, which is created due to an extensive reorganization of hydrogen bonds among back-bone atoms of protein and with water molecules in the course of conformational change. Further perspective to applying the theory to the computer-aided drug design, and to the material science, is briefly discussed.},

Thus, it is only for this correction that one relies on the integral equation. Application is made to a system consisting of a diatomic polar solvent and atomic ions of varied charge and radius. The results of these calculations show that the present approach produces sensible qualitative features of ionic solvation including an appropriately varying degree of solvent orientational saturation with ionic charge and radius. Correspondingly, the calculated interionic potentials of mean force reproduce the same basic features manifest in already available studies of dipolar hard sphere solvents, including the positions of oscillatory features in the structure and the relatively short spatial range of the corrections to the continuum dielectric theory.

  abstract = {Dynamic or structurally induced ionization is a critical aspect of many physical, chemical, and biological processes. Molecular dynamics (MD) based simulation approaches, specifically constant pH MD methods, have been developed to simulate ionization states of molecules or proteins under experimentally or physiologically relevant conditions. While such approaches are now widely utilized to predict ionization sites of macromolecules or to study physical or biological phenomena, they are often computationally expensive and require long simulation times to converge. In this article, using the principles of adiabatic free energy dynamics, we introduce an efficient technique for performing constant pH MD simulations within the framework of the adiabatic free energy dynamics (AFED) approach. We call the new approach pH-AFED. We show that pH-AFED provides highly accurate predictions of protein residue pKa values, with a MUE of 0.5 pKa units when coupled with driven adiabatic free energy dynamics (d-AFED), while reducing the required simulation times by more than an order of magnitude. In addition, pH-AFED can be easily integrated into most constant pH MD codes or implementations and flexibly adapted to work in conjunction with enhanced sampling algorithms that target collective variables. We demonstrate that our approaches, with both pH-AFED standalone as well as pH-AFED combined with collective variable based enhanced sampling, provide promising predictive accuracy, with a MUE of 0.6 and 0.5 pKa units respectively, on a diverse range of proteins and enzymes, ranging up to 186 residues and 21 titratable sites. Lastly, we demonstrate how this approach can be utilized to understand the in vivo performance engineered antibodies for immunotherapy.},

Significant improvements in experimental time resolution (similar to 100 fs instrument response) as well as corresponding improvements in analysis methods provide confidence that all of the spectral evolution (including both the inertial and the diffusive parts of the response) are observed in these measurements. Extensive data concerning the steady-state solvatochromism of C153, coupled to an examination of the effects of vibrational relaxation, further demonstrate that the spectral dynamics being observed accurately monitor the dynamics of nonspecific solvation. Comparisons to theoretical predictions show that models based on the dielectric response of the pure solvent provide a semiquantitative understanding of the dynamics observed},

We have searched the crystallography papers for all 5000+ structures and compiled binding data for 1375 (26\%) of the protein-ligand complexes. The binding-affinity data ranges 13 orders of magnitude. This is the largest collection of binding data reported to date in the literature. We have also addressed the issue of redundancy in the data. To create a nonredundant dataset, one protein from each of the 1780 protein families was chosen as a representative. Representatives were chosen by tightest binding, best resolution, etc. For the 1780 "best" complexes that comprise the nonredundant version of Binding MOAD, 475 (27\%) have binding data. This significant collection of protein-ligand complexes will be very useful in elucidating the biophysical patterns of molecular recognition and enzymatic regulation. The complexes with binding-affinity data will help in the development of improved scoring functions and structure-based drug discovery techniques. The dataset can be accessed at http://www.

  abstract = {TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase catalyzes the hydrolysis of {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, thus providing for bacterial resistance to these compounds. To determine the amino acid residues critical for the structure and function of TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase, the codons for each of the 263 amino acid residues that constitute the mature form of the enzyme were randomized using a site-directed mutagenesis procedure. Functional random mutants were selected based on their ability to confer ampicillin resistance to Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of several functional mutants was determined for each set of random mutants. It was found that 43 out of the 263 amino acid residues do not tolerate substitutions and therefore are critical for the structure and activity of the enzyme. In addition, a comparison of conserved residue positions among functional {$\beta$}-lactamase mutants with conserved residues in the P-lactamase gene family identified many positions which did not tolerate substitutions in the mutagenesis studies but are freely substituted among members of the gene family. This observation may be due to the accumulation of compensating mutations among members of the gene family. Finally, the sequence variability at residue positions among functional mutants was quantitated by calculating the effective number of substitutions at each position using information-theoretical entropy. These values were used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the correlation between the sequence variability at a position and the fractional accessible surface area of the residue. The correlation is found to be statistically significant in that buried residues tend to exhibit low variability and invariant residues tend to exhibit low solvent exposure. However, the correlation is weak because most residues are neither completely buried nor invariant.},

To support optimization efforts, a molecular dynamics (MD) based modeling workflow was implemented, providing information on QAZ binding interactions with NS5B. This approach predicted a small but critical ligand-binding induced movement of a protein backbone region which increases the pocket size and improves access to the backbone carbonyl groups of Val 494 and Pro 495. This localized backbone shift was consistent with key SAR results and was subsequently confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The MD protocol guided the design of inhibitors, exploiting novel H-bond interactions with the two backbone carbonyl groups, leading to the first thumb pocket 2 NS5B inhibitor with picomolar antiviral potency in genotype (gt) 1a and 1b replicons (EC50 = 120 and 110 pM, respectively) and with EC50 {$\leq$} 80 nM against gt 2-6. {\copyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

Adaptation to high salinity and/or extreme pH in plants and bacteria or in human heart muscles requires the action of Na+/H+ antiporters. Their activity is tightly controlled by pH. Here we present the crystal structure of pH-downregulated NhaA, the main antiporter of Escherichia coli and many enterobacteria. A negatively charged ion funnel opens to the cytoplasm and ends in the middle of the membrane at the putative ion-binding site. There, a unique assembly of two pairs of short helices connected by crossed, extended chains creates a balanced electrostatic environment. We propose that the binding of charged substrates causes an electric imbalance, inducing movements, that permit a rapid alternating-access mechanism. This ion-exchange machinery is regulated by a conformational change elicited by a pH signal perceived at the entry to the cytoplasmic funnel.}

The binding properties of this adaptive region have been explored using a "tethering" method that relies on the formation of a disulfide bond between the protein and small-molecule ligands. Using tethering, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and X-ray crystallography, we have discovered that the IL-2 adaptive region contains at least two cooperative binding sites where the binding of a first ligand to one site promotes or antagonizes the binding of a second ligand to the second site. Cooperative energies of interaction of -2 kcal/mol are observed. The observation that the adaptive region contains two adjacent sites may lead to the development of tight-binding antagonists of a protein-protein interaction. Cooperative ligand binding in the adaptive region of IL-2 underscores the importance of protein dynamics in molecular recognition. The tethering approach provides a novel and general strategy for discovering such cooperative binding interactions in specific, flexible regions of protein structure.}

The method makes use of the covariances of atomic positional fluctuations. It is illustrated by an analysis of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Comparison of the covariance and cross-correlation matrices shows that the relative motions have many similar features in the different simulations. Many regions of the protein, especially regions of secondary structure, move in a correlated manner. Anharmonic effects, which are included in the molecular dynamics simulations but not in the normal analysis, are of some importance in determining the larger scale collective motions, but not the more local fluctuations. Comparisons of molecular dynamics simulations in the present and absence of solvent indicate that the environment is of significance for the long-range motions.},

The method uses three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution functions of the atomic sites of the ligand calculated using the molecular theory of solvation, known as the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory, to identify the most probable binding modes of ligand molecules. The 3D-RISM-based method is applied to the binding of several small organic molecules to thermolysin, in order to show its efficiency and accuracy in detecting binding sites. The results demonstrate that our method can reproduce the major binding modes found by X-ray crystallographic studies with sufficient precision. Moreover, the method can successfully identify some binding modes associated with a known inhibitor, which could not be detected by X-ray analysis. The dependence of ligand-binding modes on the ligand concentration, which essentially cannot be treated with other existing computational methods, is also investigated. The results indicate that some binding modes are readily affected by the ligand concentration, whereas others are not significantly altered. In the former case, it is the subtle balance in the binding affinity between the ligand and water that determines the dominant ligand-binding mode. {\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {The bacterial adhesin FimH consists of an allosterically regulated mannose-binding lectin domain and a covalently linked inhibitory pilin domain. Under normal conditions, the two domains are bound to each other, and FimH interacts weakly with mannose. However, under tensile force, the domains separate and the lectin domain undergoes conformational changes that strengthen its bond with mannose. Comparison of the crystallographic structures of the low and the high affinity state of the lectin domain reveals conformational changes mainly in the regulatory inter-domain region, the mannose binding site and a large {$\beta$} sheet that connects the two distally located regions. Here, molecular dynamics simulations investigated how conformational changes are propagated within and between different regions of the lectin domain. It was found that the inter-domain region moves towards the high affinity conformation as it becomes more compact and buries exposed hydrophobic surface after separation of the pilin domain. The mannose binding site was more rigid in the high affinity state, which prevented water penetration into the pocket. The large central {$\beta$} sheet demonstrated a soft spring-like twisting. Its twisting motion was moderately correlated to fluctuations in both the regulatory and the binding region, whereas a weak correlation was seen in a direct comparison of these two distal sites. The results suggest a so called ``population shift'' model whereby binding of the lectin domain to either the pilin domain or mannose locks the {$\beta$} sheet in a rather twisted or flat conformation, stabilizing the low or the high affinity state, respectively.

  abstract = {In adaptive-bias enhanced sampling methods, a bias potential is added to the system to drive transitions between metastable states. The bias potential is a function of a few collective variables and is gradually modified according to the underlying free energy surface. We show that when the collective variables are suboptimal, there is an exploration--convergence tradeoff, and one must choose between a quickly converging bias that will lead to fewer transitions or a slower to converge bias that can explore the phase space more efficiently but might require a much longer time to produce an accurate free energy estimate. The recently proposed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling (OPES) method focuses on fast convergence, but there are cases where fast exploration is preferred instead. For this reason, we introduce a new variant of the OPES method that focuses on quickly escaping metastable states at the expense of convergence speed. We illustrate the benefits of this approach in prototypical systems and show that it outperforms the popular metadynamics method.},

The driving force for the transformation was the addition of several known intermolecular and receptor interhelical hydrogen bonds enforcing the necessary helical and rotameric movements. Subsquent MD simulations without constraints confirmed the stability of the activated receptor model as well as revealed new information about stabilizing residues and bonds. The active 5-HT2A receptor model was further validated by retrospective ligand screening of more than 9400 compounds, whereof 182 were known ligands.

By using ultrafast 2D-IR vibrational echo chemical-exchange spectroscopy, conformational switching between two well defined substates of a myoglobin mutant is observed on the {$\approx$}50-ps time scale. The conformational dynamics are directly measured through the growth of cross peaks in the 2D-IR spectra of CO bound to the heme active site. The conformational switching involves motion of the distal histidine/E helix that changes the location of the imidazole side group of the histidine. The exchange between substates changes the frequency of the CO, which is detected by the time dependence of the 2D-IR vibrational echo spectrum. These results demonstrate that interconversion between protein conformational substates can occur on very fast time scales. The implications for larger structural changes that occur on much longer time scales are discussed. {\copyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We study four three-point models (SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP3P-CHARMM, and TIP3P-Ew) and two four-point models (TIP4P and TIP4P-Ew). All of the models examined underestimate the surface tension; the TIP4P-Ew model comes closest to reproducing the experimental data. The surface tension can also be determined from the amplitude of capillary waves at the liquid-vapor interface by varying the surface area of the interface. The surface tensions determined from the amplitude of the logarithmic divergence of the capillary interfacial width and from the traditional thermodynamic method agree only if the density profile is fitted to an error function instead of a hyperbolic tangent function.},

All three residues of the SDN loop in Streptomyces albus G {$\beta$}-lactamase were modified by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were expressed in Streptomyces lividans, purified from culture supernatants and their kinetic parameters were determined for several substrates. Ser130 was substituted by Asn, Ala and Gly. The first modification yielded an almost totally inactive protein, whereas the smaller-side-chain mutants (A and G) retained some activity, but were less stable than the wild-type enzyme. Ser130 might thus be involved in maintaining the structure of the active-site cavity. Mutations of Asp131 into Glu and Gly proved to be highly detrimental to enzyme stability, reflecting significant structural perturbations. Mutation of Asn132 into Ala resulted in a dramatically decreased enzymic activity (more than 100-fold) especially toward cephalosporin substrates, k(cat.) being the most affected parameter, which would indicate a role of Asn132 in transition-state stabilization rather than in ground-state binding.

Molecular dynamics (MD) was carried out for 2 nanoseconds. An average structure was determined from the last nanosecond of the MD simulation, when no major structural changes were observed. This structure was used for several harmonic analysis calculations as well as for a reference structure for the quasiharmonic analysis, for both full basis and reduced basis sets. In contrast to the harmonic analysis results, the quasiharmonic reduced basis calculation using a spherical harmonics reduced basis provided good agreement with the full basis calculation, suggesting that when anharmonic effects are considered, BPTI can behave as a homogeneous object. An extensive analysis of the normal modes from a diverse set of 201 minimized MD simulation frames was performed. On only the sub-picosecond time scale were energy minima revisited after a transition to another state. This analysis shows that the dynamics average structure is not representative of the simulation frames in terms of energy and vibrational frequencies. For this model of BPTI, 42\% of the motion (mean-squared fluctuation) can be attributed to harmonic limit behavior. A spectral analysis of the correlation function of deformation for a particular normal mode or quasiharmonic mode can be used to determine the time scales of motions which correspond to harmonic vibration, large-scale drift, or sharp transitions between local substrates. {\copyright} 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

By a combination of broadband dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we have studied the relation between the protein and solvent dynamics with the aim to better understand the calorimetric glass transition, Tg, of proteins and the role of solvent for protein dynamics. The results show that both the viscosity related {$\alpha$}-relaxation in the solvent as well as several different protein relaxations are involved in the calorimetric glass transition, and that the broadness ({$\delta$}Tg) of the transition depends strongly on the total amount of solvent. The main reason for this seems to be that the protein relaxation processes become more separated in time with decreasing solvent level. The results are compared to that of hydrated myoglobin where the hydration water does not give any direct contribution to the calorimetric T g. However, the large-scale {$\alpha$}-like relaxation in the hydration water is still responsible for the protein dynamics that freeze-in at T g. Finally, the dielectric data show clearly that the protein relaxation processes exhibit similar temperature dependences as the {$\alpha$}-relaxation in the solvent, as suggested for solvent-slaved protein motions. {\copyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

With the help of computers, protein pockets prediction can save manpower and financial resources. Results: In this paper, a novel protein descriptor for the prediction of binding sites is proposed. Information on non-bonded interactions in the three-dimensional structure of a protein is captured by a combination of geometry-based and energy-based methods. Moreover, due to the rapid development of deep learning, all binding features are extracted to generate three-dimensional grids that are fed into a convolution neural network. Two datasets were introduced into the experiment. The sc-PDB dataset was used for descriptor extraction and binding site prediction, and the PDBbind dataset was used only for testing and verification of the generalization of the method. The comparison with previous methods shows that the proposed descriptor is effective in predicting the binding sites. Conclusions: A new protein descriptor is proposed for the prediction of the drug binding sites of proteins. This method combines the three-dimensional structure of a protein and non-bonded interactions with small molecules to involve important factors influencing the formation of binding site. Analysis of the experiments indicates that the descriptor is robust for site prediction.},

The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint. {\copyright} 1983 American Institute of Physics.}

  abstract = {Dopamine neurotransmitter and its receptors play a critical role in the cell signaling process responsible for information transfer in neurons functioning in the nervous system. Development of improved therapeutics for such disorders as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia would be significantly enhanced with the availability of the 3D structure for the dopamine receptors and of the binding site for dopamine and other agonists and antagonists. We report here the 3D structure of the long isoform of the human D2 dopamine receptor, predicted from primary sequence using first-principles theoretical and computational techniques (i.e., we did not use bioinformatic or experimental 3D structural information in predicting structures). The predicted 3D structure is validated by comparison of the predicted binding site and the relative binding affinities of dopamine, three known dopamine agonists (antiparkinsonian), and seven known antagonists (antipsychotic) in the D2 receptor to experimentally determined values. These structures correctly predict the critical residues for binding dopamine and several antagonists, identified by mutation studies, and give relative binding affinities that correlate well with experiments. The predicted binding site for dopamine and agonists is located between transmembrane (TM) helices 3, 4, 5, and 6, whereas the best antagonists bind to a site involving TM helices 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 with minimal contacts to TM helix 5. We identify characteristic differences between the binding sites of agonists and antagonists.}

For each pair of correlated residues, the method quantifies which residue drives the correlated motions, and which residue responds. The measure reveals how correlated motions are used to transmit information through the system, and helps to clarify the link between correlated motions and biological function in biomolecular systems. The method is illustrated by its application to the Ets-1 transcription factor, which partially unfolds upon binding DNA. The calculations show dramatic changes in the direction of information flow upon DNA binding, and elucidate how the presence of DNA is communicated from the DNA binding H1 and H3 helices to inhibitory helix HI-1.

The landscape illustrates individual valleys, which are the conformational substates. From the functional standpoint, there are two key points: first, all functionally relevant substates pre-exist; and second, the landscape is dynamic and the relative populations of the substates will change following allosteric events. Allosteric events perturb the structure, and the energetic strain propagates and shifts the population. This can lead to changes in the shapes and properties of target binding sites. Here we present an overview of dynamic conformational ensembles focusing on allosteric events in signaling.

  abstract = {The dynamics ol a folded globular protein (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) have been studied by so!J.ing the equations of motion for the atoms with an empirical potential energy function. The results provide the magnitude, correlations and decay of fluctuations about the average structure. These suggest that the protein interior is fluid-like in that the local atom motions ha1{$\bullet$}e a difji1sional character. RESULTS of X-ray crystallography provide a picture of a globular protein in its native conformation as a well defined, densely-packed structure. Other experimental data 1-to and theoretical considerations"-'" indicate that there is considerable local motion inside a protein at ordinary temperatures. Moreover, the structural data themselves show that significant residue or subunit displacements have an important role in the activity of proteins (for example, enzyme catalysis'{\textbackslash} haemo-globin cooperativity 15 , immunoglobulin action 16). To obtain a more complete understanding of proteins, it is essential to have a detailed knowledge of their dynamics. In spite of the considerable effort directed toward protein folding 17 , very little has been done to investigate the motions of a protein in the neighbourhood of its equilibrium configuration. For certain cases in which the displacements along a suitably chosen coordinate can be isolated (for example, aromatic side chain rotations in the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor'", the opening and closing of the active site cleft in lysozyme 12), it has been demonstrated that empirical energy functions can be used to analyse the motion involved. Here we undertake a more general examination of the internal dynamics of a folded globular protein. The approach used is of the molecular dynamics type'". ln such a study the classical equations of motion for all the atoms of an assembly are solved simultaneously for a suitable time period and detailed information is extracted by analysing the resulting atomic trajectories. The full interatomic potential can be used to obtain the forces on the atoms, so that the method is applicable even when the system is highly anhar-monic. The molecular dynamics approach has been very successful in revealing structural and dynamical characteristics of fluids"' {$\cdot$} As we demonstrate in what follows, molecular dynamics can have a corresponding role for the internal motions of proteins. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PTI) (see Fig. Ia) was selected for study because of its small size (58 amino acid residues), high stability and accurately determined X-ray structure""{$\cdot$}"'{$\cdot$} Four water molecules, which are strongly bound in the interior, were included in the dynamical simulation. The potentia l energy was represented by an empirical function' " composed of a sum of terms associated with bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, and non-bonded (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions. Hydrogen atoms are not explicitly considered, but are combined with the heavy atoms to which they are bonded by a suitable adjustment of atomic parameters. This use of 'extended atoms' reduces the number of interactions which must be calculated and also permits larger steps in the trajectory calculation since the high frequency hydrogen vibrations have been eliminated. Integration of the equations of motion was performed by means of the Gear algorithm 22 with time steps of 9.78 X w-IS s. X-ray coordinates 21 were used for the initial positions and the initial velocities were set equal to zero. After 100 equilibration steps, the stresses in the if)itial structure had partly relaxed and the system had an internal kinetic energy corresponding to a temperature of 140 K. At this point, all velocities were multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and 250 more equilibration steps were taken. The added kinetic energy (250.6 kcal moJ-1) partitioned itself between kinetic and potential terms during this interval, and an average kinetic temperature of 285 K was reached. The actual simulation consisted of 9,000 additional steps, corresponding to 8.8 ps. Some equilibration of the bond lengths, bond angles and electrostatic interactions continues during the first 3 ps of the simulation, producing a small rise in temperature. Over the whole simulation, the average temperature is 295 K and the total energy is well conserved, changing by only 0. 7 kcal mol-{$\cdot$} 1 {$\bullet$} ln what follows we first describe results concerned with the relation between the time-averaged and X-ray structures and with the magnitudes of structural fluctuations. We then examine the details of the dynamics, the correlation and damping of fluctuations, and some examples of the larger changes that occur. Of primary importance are the conclusions reached concerning the fluid-like nature of the internal motions, which will clearly have to be considered in developing dynamical models for biological processes. Time-averaged structure and fluctuations The time-averaged structure obtained in the dynamics run is near the X-ray structure but not identical with it; the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of the a carbons is 1.2 A and that for all the atoms is 1. 7 A. The largest deviations come from the two ends of the molecule, the external loop (residues 25-28) and exposed sidechains. The two parts of the 13 sheet (residues 18-24, 29-35) and the a helix (residues 47-56) have significantly smaller deviations. Use of the X-ray structure as the starting configuration corresponds to 0.4 kcal mol-1 of kinetic energy per atom after equilibration (140 K); for the main dynamics run (295 K), the mean kinetic energy per atom is about 0.9 kcal mol-1 {$\bullet$} Although there is no tendency to unfold, the dynamic development with this kinetic energy permits the molecule to make small rearrangements throughout; a picture of the structure after 3.2 ps is shown in Fig. lb. Apparently the PTL molecule samples a series of neighbouring conformations, the average of which is not identical with the X-ray structure. It is not clear how much of the difference is a real effect (in the sense that the structure in the crystal is constrained) and how much is due to inaccuracies in the potential function and the absence of solvent. In lysozyme, comparison of the X-ray structures for the triclinic and tetragonal crystal forms 23 ' 24 shows an r.m.s.}

  abstract = {Background The importance of protein dynamics for their biological activity is now well recognized. Different experimental and computational techniques have been employed to study protein dynamics, hierarchy of different processes and the coupling between protein and hydration water dynamics. Yet, understanding the atomistic details of protein dynamics and the role of hydration water remains rather limited. Scoop of review Based on overview of neutron scattering, molecular dynamic simulations, NMR and dielectric spectroscopy results we present a general picture of protein dynamics covering time scales from faster than ps to microseconds and the influence of hydration water on different relaxation processes. Major conclusions Internal protein dynamics spread over a wide time range from faster than picosecond to longer than microseconds. We suggest that the structural relaxation in hydrated proteins appears on the microsecond time scale, while faster processes present mostly motion of side groups and some domains. Hydration water plays a crucial role in protein dynamics on all time scales. It controls the coupled protein-hydration water relaxation on 10--100 ps time scale. This process defines the friction for slower protein dynamics. Analysis suggests that changes in amount of hydration water affect not only general friction, but also influence significantly the protein's energy landscape. General significance The proposed atomistic picture of protein dynamics provides deeper understanding of various relaxation processes and their hierarchy, similarity and differences between various biological macromolecules, including proteins, DNA and RNA.

  abstract = {Water molecules in the immediate vicinity of biomacromolecules, including proteins, constitute a hydration layer characterized by physicochemical properties different from those of bulk water and play a vital role in the activity and stability of these structures, as well as in intermolecular interactions. Previous studies using solution scattering, crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations have provided valuable information about the properties of these hydration shells, including modifications in density and ionic concentration. Small-angle scattering of x-rays (SAXS) and neutrons (SANS) are particularly useful and complementary techniques to study biomacromolecular hydration shells due to their sensitivity to electronic and nuclear scattering-length density fluctuations, respectively. Although several sophisticated SAXS/SANS programs have been developed recently, the impact of physicochemical surface properties on the hydration layer remains controversial, and systematic experimental data from individual biomacromolecular systems are scarce. Here, we address the impact of physicochemical surface properties on the hydration shell by a systematic SAXS/SANS study using three mutants of a single protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP), with highly variable net charge (+36, -6, and -29). The combined analysis of our data shows that the hydration shell is locally denser in the vicinity of acidic surface residues, whereas basic and hydrophilic/hydrophobic residues only mildly modify its density. Moreover, the data demonstrate that the density modifications result from the combined effect of residue-specific recruitment of ions from the bulk in combination with water structural rearrangements in their vicinity. Finally, we find that the specific surface-charge distributions of the different GFP mutants modulate the conformational space of flexible parts of the protein.}

  abstract = {A new approach to investigate a molecular recognition process of protein is presented based on the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory, a statistical mechanics theory of molecular liquids. Numerical procedure for solving the conventional 3D-RISM equation consists of two steps. In step 1, we solve ordinary RISM (or 1D-RISM) equations for a solvent mixture including target ligands in order to obtain the density pair correlation functions (PCF) among molecules in the solution. Then, we solve the 3D-RISM equation for a solute-solvent system to find three-dimensional density distribution functions (3D-DDF) of solvent species around a protein, using PCF obtained in the first step. A key to the success of the method was to regard a target ligand as one of "solvent" species. However, the success is limited due to a difficulty of solving the 1D-RISM equation for a solvent mixture, including large ligand molecules. In the present paper, we propose a method which eases the limitation concerning solute size in the conventional method. In this approach, we solve a solute-solute 3D-RISM equations for a protein-ligand system in which both proteins and ligands are regarded as "solutes" at infinite dilution. The 3D- and 1D-RISM equations are solved for protein-solvent and ligand-solvent systems, respectively, in order to obtain the 3D- and 1D-DDF of solvent around the solutes, which are required for solving the solute-solute 3D-RISM equation. The method is applied to two practical and noteworthy examples concerning pharmaceutical design. One is an odorant binding protein in the Drosophila melanogaster, which binds an ethanol molecule. The other is phospholipase A2, which is known as a receptor of acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin. The result indicates that the method successfully reproduces the binding mode of the ligand molecules in the binding sites measured by the experiments. {\copyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

The rate of deacylation generally slowed by as much as 10-7 compared to the wild type. The acyl enzyme intermediate was observed by HPLC, but not by X-ray diffraction. The mutant was crystallized from metboxyPEG 5000 at pH 6.2 in space group P21 with Z = 4.

Changes in the positions of the reactive Ser70 and conserved Lys73 are not significant, suggesting that the proposed salt linkage to Glu166 in the wild type enzyme is weak or non-existent. The calculated solvent exposure of Ser70 and Lys73 increases slightly and a buried water molecule is now positioned near Lys73. The hydrolytic water seen in the native active site shifts markedly by 1.6 {\AA}, but is held in the active site by Asn170, which possibly becomes an ineffective substitute for Glu166 in activating the water for deacylation. {\copyright} 1993 Oxford University Press.},

  abstract = {Conformational dynamics are increasingly recognized as being essential for enzyme function. However, there is virtually no direct experimental evidence to support the notion that individual dynamic modes are required for specific catalytic processes, apart from the initial step of substrate binding. In this work, we use a unique approach based on millisecond hydrogen--deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to identify dynamic modes linked to individual catalytic processes in the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase. Using a ``good'' substrate (ampicillin), a poorly hydrolyzed substrate (cephalexin) and a covalent inhibitor (clavulanate), we are able to isolate dynamic modes that are specifically linked to substrate binding, productive lactam ring hydrolysis and deacylation. These discoveries are ultimately translated into specific targets for allosteric TEM-1 inhibitor development.},

  abstract = {Buried water molecules and the water molecules in the active-site gorge are analyzed for five crystal structures of acetylcholinesterase from Torpedo californica in the resolution range 2.2-2.5 {\AA} (native enzyme, and four inhibitor complexes). A total of 45 buried hydration sites are identified, which are populated with between 36 and 41 water molecules. About half of the buried water is located in a distinct region neighboring the active-site gorge. Most of the buried water molecules are very well conserved among the five structures, and have low displacement parameters, B, of magnitudes similar to those of the main-chain atoms of the central {$\beta$}-sheet structure. The active-site gorge of the native enzyme is filled with over 20 water molecules, which have poor hydrogen-bond coordination with an average of 2.9 polar contacts per water molecule. Upon ligand binding, distinct groups of these water molecules are displaced, whereas the others remain in positions similar to those that they occupy in the native enzyme. Possible roles of the buried water molecules are discussed, including their possible action as a lubricant to allow large-amplitude fluctuations of the loop structures forming the gorge wall. Such fluctuations are required to facilitate traffic of substrate, products and water molecules to and from the active-site. Because of their poor coordination, the gorge water molecules can be considered as 'activated' as compared to bulk water. This should allow their easy displacement by incoming substrate. The relatively loose packing of the gorge water molecules leaves numerous small voids, and more efficient space-filling by substrates and inhibitors may be a major driving force of ligand binding.

Advances in lab-based structural biology and related computational approaches like AlphaFold have made great strides in obtaining static protein structures for biologically relevant targets. However, biology is in constant motion, and many important biological processes rely on conformationally driven events. Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations run on standard hardware are impractical for many drug design projects, where conformationally driven biological events can take microseconds to milliseconds or longer. An alternative approach is to focus the search on a limited region of conformational space defined by a putative reaction coordinate (i.e., path collective variable).

The challenge is striking a balance between the degree to which the system is constrained and still allowing for natural motions along the path. A plethora of restraints exist to limit the size of conformational search space, although each has drawbacks when simulating complex biological motions. In this work, we present a three-stage procedure to construct realistic path collective variables (PCVs) and introduce a new kind of barrier restraint that is particularly well suited for complex conformationally driven biological events, such as allosteric modulations and conformational signaling. The PCV presented here is all-atom (as opposed to C-alpha or backbone only) and is derived from all-atom MD trajectory frames.

  abstract = {Computational mapping methods place molecular probes (small molecules or functional groups) on a protein surface to identify the most favorable binding positions by calculating an interaction potential. We have developed a novel computational mapping program called CS-Map (computational solvent mapping of proteins), which differs from earlier mapping methods in three respects: (i) it initially moves the ligands on the protein surface toward regions with favorable electrostatics and desolvation, (ii) the final scoring potential accounts for desolvation, and (iii) the docked ligand positions are clustered, and the clusters are ranked on the basis of their average free energies. To understand the relative importance of these factors, we developed alternative algorithms that use the DOCK and GRAMM programs for the initial search. Because of the availability of experimental solvent mapping data, lysozyme and thermolysin are considered as test proteins. Both DOCK and GRAMM speed up the initial search, and the combined algorithms yield acceptable mapping results. However, the DOCK-based approaches place the consensus site farther from its experimentally determined position than CS-Map, primarily because of the lack of a solvation term in the initial search. The GRAMM-based program also finds the correct consensus site for thermolysin. We conclude that good sampling is the most important requirement for successful mapping, but accounting for desolvation and clustering of ligand positions also help to reduce the number of false positives. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The fact that an anhydride of rela- tively high-energy content is the method of driving the reaction thermodynamically fits in with organic practice in which acyl anhydrides are the usual reagents for acylations. In addition to thermodynamic activation, there is a needed "kinetic activation." For example, the acyl phosphates and acyl adenylates acylate amines non-enzymatically at appreciable rates in aqueous solution, but this reaction is certainly not rapid enough or selective enough to account for protein synthesis. The reaction of these acyl anhydrides to form peptides must be catalyzed, and it is this catalysis which is the subject of this paper.},

The electron and classical subsystems are coupled in the mean field approximation. The procedure takes account of many-body effects of dense fluid on the metal--liquid interactions by averaging the pseudopotentials of liquid molecules over the classical distributions of the liquid. The proposed approach is substantially less time-consuming as compared to a Car--Parrinello-type simulation since it replaces molecular dynamics with the integral equation theory of molecular liquids. The calculation has been performed for pure water at normal conditions in contact with the 100 face cubic centered fcc surface of a metal roughly modeled after copper. The results are in good agreement with the Car--Parrinello simulation for the same metal model. The shift of the Fermi level due to the presence of water conforms with experiment. The electron distribution near an adsorbed water molecule is affected by dense water, and so the metal--water attraction follows the shapes of the metal effective electrostatic potential. For the metal model employed, it is strongest at the hollow site adsorption positions, and water molecules are adsorbed mainly at the hollow and bridge site positions rather than over metal atoms. Layering of water molecules near the metal surface is found. In the first hydration layer, adsorbed water molecules are oriented in parallel to the surface or tilted with hydrogens mainly outwards the metal. This orientation at the potential of zero charge agrees with experiment.},

In the conformational selection model, a protein samples a scarcely populated high-energy state that resembles a target-bound conformation. In enzymatic catalysis, such high-energy states have been identified as crucial entities for activity and the dynamic interconversion between ground states and high-energy states can constitute the rate-limiting step for catalytic turnover. The transient nature of these states has precluded direct observation of their properties. Here, we present a molecular description of a high-energy enzyme state in a conformational selection pathway by an experimental strategy centered on NMR spectroscopy, protein engineering, and X-ray crystallography. Through the introduction of a disulfide bond, we succeeded in arresting the enzyme adenylate kinase in a closed high-energy conformation that is on-pathway for catalysis. A 1.9-{\AA} X-ray structure of the arrested enzyme in complex with a transition state analog shows that catalytic sidechains are properly aligned for catalysis. We discovered that the structural sampling of the substrate free enzyme corresponds to the complete amplitude that is associated with formation of the closed and catalytically active state. In addition, we found that the trapped high-energy state displayed improved ligand binding affinity, compared with the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that substrate binding to the high-energy state is not occluded by steric hindrance. Finally, we show that quenching of fast time scale motions observed upon ligand binding to adenylate kinase is dominated by enzyme--substrate interactions and not by intramolecular interactions resulting from the conformational change.},

Regions that bind clusters of multiple probe types identify the binding hot spots in good agreement with experimental data. FTMap serves as the basis for other servers, namely FTSite, which is used to predict ligand-binding sites, FTFlex, which is used to account for side chain flexibility, FTMap/param, used to parameterize additional probes and FTDyn, for mapping ensembles of protein structures. Applications include determining the druggability of proteins, identifying ligand moieties that are most important for binding, finding the most bound-like conformation in ensembles of unliganded protein structures and providing input for fragment-based drug design. FTMap is more accurate than classical mapping methods such as GRID and MCSS, and it is much faster than the more-recent approaches to protein mapping based on mixed molecular dynamics. By using 16 probe molecules, the FTMap server finds the hot spots of an average-size protein in {$<$}1 h. As FTFlex performs mapping for all low-energy conformers of side chains in the binding site, its completion time is proportionately longer.}

To this end a number of geometric definitions of hydrogen bonding in water have been developed. While all definitions of hydrogen bonding are to some extent arbitrary, those involving one distance and one angle for a given water dimer are unnecessarily so. In this paper the authors develop a systematic procedure based on two-dimensional potentials of mean force for defining cutoffs for a given pair of distance and angular coordinates. They also develop an electronic structure-based definition of hydrogen bonding in liquid water, related to the electronic occupancy of the antibonding OH orbitals. This definition turns out to be reasonably compatible with one of the distance-angle geometric definitions. These two definitions lead to an estimate of the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in liquid simple point charge/extended (SPC/E) water of between 3.2 and 3.4. They also used these and other hydrogen-bond definitions to examine the dynamics of local hydrogen-bond number fluctuations, finding an approximate long-time decay constant for SPC/E water of between 0.8 and 0.9 ps, which corresponds to the time scale for local structural relaxation.},

  abstract = {Allosteric effect implies ligand binding at one site leading to structural and/or dynamical changes at a distant site. PDZ domains are classic examples of dynamic allostery without conformational changes, where distal side-chain dynamics is modulated on ligand binding and the origin has been attributed to entropic effects. In this work, we unearth the energetic basis of the observed dynamic allostery in a PDZ3 domain protein using molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that electrostatic interaction provides a highly sensitive yardstick to probe the allosteric modulation in contrast to the traditionally used structure-based parameters. There is a significant population shift in the hydrogen-bonded network and salt bridges involving side chains on ligand binding. The ligand creates a local energetic perturbation that propagates in the form of dominolike changes in interresidue interaction pattern. There are significant changes in the nature of specific interactions (nonpolar/ polar) between interresidue contacts and accompanied side-chain reorientations that drive the major redistribution of energy. In-terestingly, this internal redistribution and rewiring of side-chain interactions led to large cancellations resulting in small change in the overall enthalpy of the protein, thus making it difficult to detect experimentally. In contrast to the prevailing focus on the entropic or dynamic effects, we show that the internal redistribution and population shift in specific electrostatic interactions drive the allosteric modulation in the PDZ3 domain protein.

  abstract = {This chapter describes many of the techniques employed to study water-macromolecules interactions, their general usefulness, points out areas of mutual support and contradiction. The chapter also presents hydration of other macromolecules and the hydration of small molecules. Four broadly based approaches to operational definitions of hydration include---(1) preferential hydration, (2) hydrodynamic hydration, (3) structural hydration, and (4) low temperature hydration. The use of high resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction data on protein crystals provides an independent approach for estimation of hydration. The chapter presents several proposals for predicting protein hydration based on the amino acid composition of the protein; however, the two main questions concerned include---whether ionic groups are more hydrated than other polar groups, and whether the amide and peptide functions are hydrated or not. Low pH, and to a much smaller degree, high pH should dehydrate proteins. Intermolecular association via ionic mechanisms should be strongly dehydrating; whereas hydrophobic interactions should not have much effect on hydration levels. Although, there is a presumption that both the enthalpy and the entropy are negative for the process of adding water molecules to isolated proteins, which are maintained in their native conformations, but there is no unequivocal evidence for this. {\copyright} 1974 Academic Press Inc.}

The water reorientation is shown to occur through large-amplitude angular jumps due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments. In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results, the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor water approaches.},

  abstract = {A new cluster series, called the interaction site cluster expansion, is derived for classical molecular fluids. For a general class of molecular models, the series provides an exact formula for the equilibrium pair correlations between interaction sites on different molecules. In the models considered, each molecule contains m of these interaction sites. The total intermolecular potential between two molecules is the sum of m 2 site--site potentials. A site--site potential depends on the separation between the sites only. However, because the sites are not necessarily located at the centers of molecules, the total molecular pair interaction can depend strongly on molecular orientations. Even though the interaction site cluster expansion is exact, the cluster integrals in the series involve the translational coordinates of the interaction sites only. The molecular orientational coordinates are removed by a transformation which introduces i n t r amolecular correlation functions into the series. Thus, the new cluster series expresses the intermolecular site--site correlation functions in terms of diagrams involving site--site cluster bonds and i n t r amolecular correlation bonds. The interaction site cluster expansions are used to derive several important results. It is shown that when the site--site interactions are hard core potentials, the pair correlation functions rigorously contain not only discontinuities but also cusps. The locations for these singularities are derived. A method is presented which shows how these singularities are smoothed when the hard core potentials are softened. The singularities as well as special limiting results derived herein are used to provide a justification for the reference interaction site model (RISM) equation.},

Unbiased alchemical free energy surfaces are naturally recovered by Thermodynamic Integration (TI). No manual optimization of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ schedule is required as the sampling of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ variable is continuous and converges towards a uniform distribution. Free diffusion of \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ improves orthogonal relaxation compared to fixed \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ methods such as standard TI or Free Energy Perturbation (FEP). Furthermore, the multiple walker strategy provides coverage of orthogonal space in a generic way with minimal user input and negligible computational overhead. Of practical importance, no adiabatic decoupling between the alchemical and Cartesian degrees of freedom is assumed, ensuring unbiased estimates for a wide envelope of numerical parameters. We present two high-performance implementations of the method in production molecular dynamics engines, namely NAMD and Tinker-HP, through coupling with the Colvars open source library. These interfaces enable the combination of the rich feature sets of those packages. We demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the approach on several real-world cases: from solvation free energies up to ligand-receptor binding (using a recently proposed binding restraint scheme) with both fixed-charge and polarizable models. We find that, for a chosen accuracy, the computational cost is strongly reduced compared to state-of-the-art fixed-lambda methods and that results within 1{\textasciitilde}kcal/mol of experimental value are recovered for the most complex system.

We propose a software implementation and showcase it on biomolecular systems. The method arises from coupling multiple-walker adaptive biasing force with {$\lambda$}-dynamics. The sampling of the alchemical variable is continuous and converges toward a uniform distribution, making manual optimization of the {$\lambda$} schedule unnecessary. Contrary to most other approaches, alchemical freeenergy estimates are obtained immediately without any postprocessing. Free diffusion of {$\lambda$} improves orthogonal relaxation compared to fixed-{$\lambda$} thermodynamic integration or free-energy perturbation. Furthermore, multiple walkers provide generic orthogonal space coverage with minimal user input and negligible computational overhead. We show that our highperformance implementations coupling the Colvars library with NAMD and Tinker-HP can address real-world cases including ligand-receptor binding with both fixed-charge and polarizable models, with a demonstrably richer sampling than fixed-{$\lambda$} methods. The implementation is fully open-source, publicly available, and readily usable by practitioners of current alchemical methods. Thanks to the portable Colvars library, lambda-ABF presents a unified user interface regardless of the back-end (NAMD, Tinker-HP, or any software to be interfaced in the future), sparing users the effort of learning multiple interfaces. Finally, the Colvars Dashboard extension of the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software provides an interactive monitoring and diagnostic tool for lambda-ABF simulations.},

  abstract = {High binding affinity and selectivity of metal ions are essential to the function of metalloproteins. Thus, understanding the factors that determine these binding characteristics is of major interest for both fundamental mechanistic investigations and guiding of the design of novel metalloproteins. In this work, we perform QM cluster model calculations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energy simulations to understand the binding selectivity of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the wild-type carp parvalbumin and its mutant. While a nonpolarizable MM model (CHARMM36) does not lead to the correct experimental trend, treatment of the metal binding site with the DFTB3 model in a QM/MM framework leads to relative binding free energies ({$\Delta\Delta$}Gbind) comparable with experimental data. For the wild-type (WT) protein, the calculated {$\Delta\Delta$}Gbind is {$\sim$}6.6 kcal/mol in comparison with the experimental value of 5.6 kcal/mol. The good agreement highlights the value of a QM description of the metal binding site and supports the role of electronic polarization and charge transfer to metal binding selectivity. For the D51A/E101D/F102W mutant, different binding site models lead to considerable variations in computed binding affinities. With a coordination number of seven for Ca2+, which is shown by QM/MM metadynamics simulations to be the dominant coordination number for the mutant, the calculated relative binding affinity is {$\sim$}4.8 kcal/mol, in fair agreement with the experimental value of 1.6 kcal/mol. The WT protein is observed to feature a flexible binding site that accommodates a range of coordination numbers for Ca2+, which is essential to the high binding selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+. In the mutant, the E101D mutation reduces the flexibility of the binding site and limits the dominant coordination number of Ca2+ to be seven, thereby leading to reduced binding selectivity against Mg2+. Our results highlight that the binding selectivity of metal ions depends on both the structural and dynamical properties of the protein binding site.},

To address this, we developed an iterative procedure involving Grand Canonical-like Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Each iteration involves GCMC of both the solutes and water followed by MD, with the excess chemical potential ({$\mu$}ex) of both the solute and the water oscillated to attain their target concentrations in the simulation system. By periodically varying the {$\mu$}ex of the water and solutes over the GCMC-MD iterations, solute exchange probabilities and the spatial distributions of the solutes improved. The utility of the oscillating-{$\mu$}ex GCMC-MD method is indicated by its ability to approximate the hydration free energy (HFE) of the individual solutes in aqueous solution as well as in dilute aqueous mixtures of multiple solutes. For seven organic solutes: benzene, propane, acetaldehyde, methanol, formamide, acetate, and methylammonium, the average {$\mu$}ex of the solutes and the water converged close to their respective HFEs in both 1 M standard state and dilute aqueous mixture systems. The oscillating-{$\mu$}ex GCMC methodology is also able to drive solute sampling in proteins in aqueous environments as shown using the occluded binding pocket of the T4 lysozyme L99A mutant as a model system. The approach was shown to satisfactorily reproduce the free energy of binding of benzene as well as sample the functional group requirements of the occluded pocket consistent with the crystal structures of known ligands bound to the L99A mutant as well as their relative binding affinities.},

As the pKa of ionizable residues depends on their environment, it represents a simple metric to monitor changes in several complex factors induced by binding an allosteric effector.

Here, we describe a new method of ligand binding site prediction called Q-SiteFinder. It uses the interaction energy between the protein and a simple van der Waals probe to locate energetically favourable binding sites. Energetically favourable probe sites are clustered according to their spatial proximity and clusters are then ranked according to the sum of interaction energies for sites within each cluster. Results: There is at least one successful prediction in the top three predicted sites in 90\% of proteins tested when using Q-SiteFinder. This success rate is higher than that of a commonly used pocket detection algorithm (Pocket-Finder) which uses geometric criteria. Additionally, Q-SiteFinder is twice as effective as Pocket-Finder in generating predicted sites that map accurately onto ligand coordinates. It also generates predicted sites with the lowest average volumes of the methods examined in this study. Unlike pocket detection, the volumes of the predicted sites appear to show relatively low dependence on protein volume and are similar in volume to the ligands they contain. Restricting the size of the pocket is important for reducing the search space required for docking and de novo drug design or site comparison. The method can be applied in structural genomics studies where protein binding sites remain uncharacterized since the 86\% success rate for unbound proteins appears to be only slightly lower than that of ligand-bound proteins. {\copyright} The Author 2005.

  abstract = {Water is essential in many biological processes, and the hydration structure plays a critical role in facilitating protein folding, dynamics, and ligand binding. A variety of biophysical spectroscopic techniques have been used to probe the water solvating proteins, often complemented with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to resolve the spatial and dynamic features of the hydration shell, but comparing relative water structure is challenging. In this study 1 {$\mu$}s MD simulations were performed to identify and characterize hydration sites around HIV-1 protease bound to an inhibitor, darunavir (DRV). The water density, hydration site occupancy, extent and anisotropy of fluctuations, coordinated water molecules, and hydrogen bonds were characterized and compared to the properties of bulk water. The water density of the principal hydration shell was found to be higher than bulk, dependent on the topology and physiochemical identity of the biomolecular surface. The dynamics of water molecules occupying principal hydration sites was highly dependent on the number of water-water interactions and inversely correlated with hydrogen bonds to the protein-inhibitor complex. While many waters were conserved following the symmetry of homodimeric HIV protease, the asymmetry induced by DRV resulted in asymmetric lower-occupancy hydration sites at the concave surface of the active site. Key interactions between water molecules and the protease, that stabilize the protein in the inhibited form, were altered in a drug resistant variant of the protease indicating that modulation of solvent-solute interactions might play a key role in conveying drug resistance. Our analysis provides insights into the interplay between an enzyme inhibitor complex and the hydration shell and has implications in elucidating water structure in a variety of biological processes and applications including ligand binding, inhibitor design, and resistance.}

Here we report that the clinical kinase inhibitor bosutinib recognizes its kinase targets by engaging a pair of conserved structured water molecules in the active site and that many other kinase inhibitors share a similar recognition mechanism. Using the nitrile group of bosutinib as an infrared probe, we show that the gatekeeper residue and one other position in the ATP-binding site control access of the drug to the structured water molecules and that the amino acids found at these positions account for the kinome-wide target spectrum of the drug. Our work highlights the importance of structured water molecules for inhibitor recognition, reveals a new role for the kinase gatekeeper and showcases an effective approach for elucidating the molecular origins of selectivity patterns.}

At physiological temperatures, functional motions arise from the complex interplay of thermal motions of proteins and their environments. Here, we determine the hierarchy in the protein conformational energy landscape that underlies these motions, based on a series of temperature-dependent magic-angle spinning multinuclear nuclear-magnetic-resonance relaxation measurements in a hydrated nanocrystalline protein. The results support strong coupling between protein and solvent dynamics above 160 kelvin, with fast solvent motions, slow protein side-chain motions, and fast protein backbone motions being activated consecutively. Low activation energy, small-amplitude local motions dominate at low temperatures, with larger-amplitude, anisotropic, and functionally relevant motions involving entire peptide units becoming dominant at temperatures above 220 kelvin.}

Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu's protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.},

Using site-directed mutation and with femtosecond resolution, we experimentally observed relaxation dynamics with a biphasic distribution of time scales, 5 and 87 ps, around the site Trp7. Theoretical studies using both linear response and direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) calculations reproduced the biphasic behavior. Further constrained MD simulations with either frozen protein or frozen water revealed the molecular mechanism of slow hydration processes and elucidated the role of protein fluctuations. Observation of slow water dynamics in MD simulations requires protein flexibility, regardless of whether the slow Stokes shift component results from the water or protein contribution. The initial dynamics in a few picoseconds represents fast local motions such as reorientations and translations of hydrating water molecules, followed by slow relaxation involving strongly coupled water-protein motions. We observed a transition from one isomeric protein configuration to another after 10 ns during our 30 ns ground-state simulation. For one isomer, the surface hydration energy dominates the slow component of the total relaxation energy. For the other isomer, the slow component is dominated by protein interactions with the chromophore. In both cases, coupled water-protein motion is shown to be necessary for observation of the slow dynamics. Such biologically important water-protein motions occur on tens of picoseconds. One significant discrepancy exists between theory and experiment, the large inertial relaxation predicted by simulations but clearly absent in experiment. Further improvements required in the theoretical model are discussed.},

PKA-C substrate recognition, active site organization, and product re-lease depend on the enzyme's conformational transitions from the open to the closed state, which regulate its allosteric cooperativity. Here, we used equilibrium NMR hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) fractionation factors ({$\varphi$}) to probe the changes in the strength of hydrogen bonds within the kinase upon binding the nucleotide and a pseudo-substrate peptide (PKI5-24). We found that the {$\varphi$} values decrease upon binding both ligands, suggesting that the overall hydrogen bond networks in both the small and large lobes of PKA-C becomes stronger. However, we observed several important exceptions, with residues displaying higher {$\varphi$} values upon ligand binding. Notably, the changes in {$\varphi$} values are not localized near the ligand binding pockets; rather, they are radiated throughout the entire enzyme. We conclude that, upon ligand and pseudo-substrate binding, the hydrogen bond networks undergo extensive reorganization, revealing that the open-to-close transitions require global rearrangements of the internal forces that stabilize the enzyme's fold.},

A new program, CAST, for automatically locating and measuring protein pockets and cavities, is based on precise computational geometry methods, including alpha shape and discrete flow theory. CAST identifies and measures pockets and pocket mouth openings, as well as cavities. The program specifies the atoms lining pockets, pocket openings, and buried cavities; the volume and area of pockets and cavities; and the area and circumference of mouth openings. CAST analysis of over 100 proteins has been carried out; proteins examined include a set of 51 monomeric enzyme-ligand structures, several elastase-inhibitor complexes, the FK506 binding protein, 30 HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complexes, and a number of small and large protein inhibitors. Medium-sized globular proteins typically have 10-20 pockets/cavities. Most often, binding sites are pockets with 1-2 mouth openings; much less frequently they are cavities. Ligand binding pockets vary widely in size, most within the range 102-103 {\AA}3. Statistical analysis reveals that the number of pockets and cavities is correlated with protein size, but there is no correlation between the size of the protein and the size of binding sites. Most frequently, the largest pocket/cavity is the active site, but there are a number of instructive exceptions. Ligand volume and binding site volume are somewhat correlated when binding site volume is {$\leq$}700 {\AA}3, but the ligand seldom occupies the entire site. Auxiliary pockets near the active site have been suggested as additional binding surface for designed ligands (Mattos C et al., 1994, Nat Struct Biol 1:55-58). Analysis of elastase-inhibitor complexes suggests that CAST can identify ancillary pockets suitable for recruitment in ligand design strategies. Analysis of the FK506 binding protein, and of compounds developed in SAR by NMR (Shuker SB et al., 1996, Science 274:1531-1534), indicates that CAST pocket computation may provide a priori identification of target proteins for linked-fragment design. CAST analysis of 30 HIV-1 protease- inhibitor complexes shows that the flexible active site pocket can vary over a range of 853-1,566 {\AA}3, and that there are two pockets near or adjoining the active site that may be recruited for ligand design.},

  abstract = {Conformational changes are crucial for the catalytic action of many enzymes. A prototypical and well-studied example is loop opening and closure in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), which is thought to determine the rate of catalytic turnover in many circumstances. Specifically, TIM loop 6 "grips" the phosphodianion of the substrate and, together with a change in loop 7, sets up the TIM active site for efficient catalysis. Crystal structures of TIM typically show an open or a closed conformation of loop 6, with the tip of the loop moving {$\sim$}7 {\AA} between conformations. Many studies have interpreted this motion as a two-state, rigid-body transition. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations, with both conventional and enhanced sampling techniques, to analyze loop motion in apo and substrate-bound TIM in detail, using five crystal structures of the dimeric TIM from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that loop 6 is highly flexible and samples multiple conformational states. Empirical valence bond simulations of the first reaction step show that slight displacements away from the fully closed-loop conformation can be sufficient to abolish most of the catalytic activity; full closure is required for efficient reaction. The conformational change of the loops in TIM is thus not a simple "open and shut" case and is crucial for its catalytic action. Our detailed analysis of loop motion in a highly efficient enzyme highlights the complexity of loop conformational changes and their role in biological catalysis.},

  abstract = {The structure of proteins has long been recognized to hold the key to understanding and engineering their function, and rapid advances in structural biology and protein structure prediction are now supplying researchers with an ever-increasing wealth of structural information. Most of the time, however, structures can only be determined in free energy minima, one at a time. While conformational flexibility may thus be inferred from static end-state structures, their interconversion mechanisms-a central ambition of structural biology-are often beyond the scope of direct experimentation. Given the dynamical nature of the processes in question, many studies have attempted to explore conformational transitions using molecular dynamics (MD). However, ensuring proper convergence and reversibility in the predicted transitions is extremely challenging. In particular, a commonly used technique to map out a path from a starting to a target conformation called steered MD (SMD) can suffer from starting-state dependence (hysteresis) when combined with techniques such as umbrella sampling (US) to compute the free energy profile of a transition. Here, we study this problem in detail on conformational changes of increasing complexity. We also present a new, history-independent approach that we term ``MEMENTO'' (Morphing End states by Modelling Ensembles with iNdependent TOpologies) to generate paths that alleviate hysteresis in the construction of conformational free energy profiles. MEMENTO utilizes template-based structure modelling to restore physically reasonable protein conformations based on coordinate interpolation (morphing) as an ensemble of plausible intermediates, from which a smooth path is picked. We compare SMD and MEMENTO on well-characterized test cases (the toy peptide deca-alanine and the enzyme adenylate kinase) before discussing its use in more complicated systems (the kinase P38{$\alpha$} and the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT). Our work shows that for all but the simplest systems SMD paths should not in general be used to seed umbrella sampling or related techniques, unless the paths are validated by consistent results from biased runs in opposite directions. MEMENTO, on the other hand, performs well as a flexible tool to generate intermediate structures for umbrella sampling. We also demonstrate that extended end-state sampling combined with MEMENTO can aid the discovery of collective variables on a case-by-case basis.},

  abstract = {Exploring the free-energy landscape along reaction coordinates or system parameters \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ is central to many studies of high-dimensional model systems in physics, e.g. large molecules or spin glasses. In simulations this usually requires sampling conformational transitions or phase transitions, but efficient sampling is often difficult to attain due to the roughness of the energy landscape. For Boltzmann distributions, crossing rates decrease exponentially with free-energy barrier heights. Thus, exponential acceleration can be achieved in simulations by applying an artificial bias along \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ tuned such that a flat target distribution is obtained. A flat distribution is however an ambiguous concept unless a proper metric is used, and is generally suboptimal. Here we propose a multidimensional Riemann metric, which takes the local diffusion into account, and redefine uniform sampling such that it is invariant under nonlinear coordinate transformations. We use the metric in combination with the accelerated weight histogram method, a free-energy calculation and sampling method, to adaptively optimize sampling toward the target distribution prescribed by the metric. We demonstrate that for complex problems, such as molecular dynamics simulations of DNA base-pair opening, sampling uniformly according to the metric, which can be calculated without significant computational overhead, improves sampling efficiency by 50-70\%.},

This paper deals with the theoretical foundations and establishes the range of validity of this approach, and the accompanying paper demonstrates how a wide variety of experimental relaxation data can be successfully analyzed by using this approach. For both isotropic and anisotropic overall motion, it is shown that the unique information on fast internal motions contained in relaxation experiments can be completely specified by two model-independent quantities: ( 1) a generalized order parameter, S, which is a measure of the spatial restriction of the motion, and (2) an effective correlation time, tau\_e, which is a measure of the rate of motion. A simple expression for the spectral density involving these two parameters is derived and is shown to be exact when the internal (but not overall) motions are in the extreme narrowing limit. The model-free approach (so called because S{\textasciicircum}2 and tau\_e, have model-independent significance) consists of using the above spectral density to least-squares fit relaxation data by treating S{\textasciicircum}2 and tau\_e, as adjustable parameters. The range of validity of this approach is illustrated by analyzing error-free relaxation data generated by using sophisticated dynamical models. Empirical rules are presented that allow one to estimate the accuracy of S{\textasciicircum}2 and tau\_e. extracted by using the model-free approach by considering their numerical values, the resonance frequencies, and the parameters for the overall motion. For fast internal motions, it is unnecessary to use approaches based on complicated spectral densities derived within the framework of a model because all models that can give the correct value of S{\textasciicircum}2 work equally well. The unique dynamic information (S and tau\_e) can be easily extracted by using the model-free approach. Moreover, if one desires a physical picture of the motion, the numerical values of S{\textasciicircum}2 and tau\_e can be readily interpreted within a physically reasonable model.},

  abstract = {Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) is a V-type allosteric enzyme, meaning that its catalytic rate is critically dependent on activation by its allosteric ligand, N{$\prime$}-[(5{$\prime$}-phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (PRFAR). The alloste-ric mechanism of IGPS is reliant on millisecond conformational motions for efficient catalysis. We engineered four mutants of IGPS designed to disrupt millisecond motions and allosteric coupling to identify regions that are critical to IGPS function. Multiple-quantum Carr--Purcell--Mei-boom--Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion experiments and NMR chem-ical shift titrations reveal diminished enzyme flexibility and a reshaping of the allosteric connectivity in each mutant construct, respectively. The functional relevance of the observed motional quenching is confirmed by significant reductions in glutaminase kinetic activity and allosteric ligand binding affinity. This work presents relevant conclusions toward the control of protein allo-stery and design of unique allosteric sites for potential enzyme inhibitors with regulatory or therapeutic benefit. allostery {\textbar} NMR {\textbar} community networks {\textbar} millisecond motions T he underlying principles of allosteric regulation have been a focal point of enzymology and structural biology for decades as studies of allostery have evolved from two phenomenological models (1, 2) to recognize structural and conformational ensem-bles that define a broad range of enzymatic states (3--6). As a result, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on understanding dynamic contributions to allostery (7--12) and factors that enable small fluctuations in local conformations of enzymes to propagate information over large distances. A well-developed understanding of dynamic allostery opens up numerous avenues for insight into protein engineering (13, 14), drug design (15), and mechanistic bio-chemistry (16--22). To establish universal principles for relevant en-zymes, however, a link between dynamics and function must be made. The heterodimeric enzyme imidazole glycerol phosphate syn-thase (IGPS) plays a crucial role in amino acid and purine bio-synthesis in bacteria and other microorganisms by sequentially catalyzing the hydrolysis of glutamine (Gln) in its HisH subunit and the cyclization of the substrate and allosteric effector N{$\prime$}-[(5{$\prime$}-phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ri-bonucleotide (PRFAR) in its HisF subunit (Scheme 1). IGPS is a V-type allosteric enzyme that is inactive unless PRFAR is bound, and communication between the active and effector sites is driven by the enhancement of conformational flexibility, namely, fluctua-tions taking place on the millisecond timescale (22--24). Based on NMR and computational evidence, these motions are believed to propagate from the PRFAR binding site to the glutaminase binding site, thereby disrupting a hydrogen bond between V51 and P10 of HisH. This H bond prevents formation of the oxyanion hole site necessary for glutamine hydrolysis, and its disruption allows IGPS to conformationally sample the activated state. Recently, we have advanced these studies and demonstrated that activation of IGPS is dependent on the ability of allosteric effectors to stimulate domain-wide motions in the HisF subunit and ligands that induce greater motion within the central ({$\alpha\beta$}) 8 barrel are more effective activators of glutaminase chemistry (22). NMR and computational community network studies proposed an optimal allosteric pathway through networks of HisF amino acid residues that link the PRFAR binding site and adjacent flexible loop 1 to residues comprising a central hydrophobic cluster essential for catalysis, as well as salt bridge residues at the dimer interface (25, 26). These previous results suggest important amino acids in each community that, upon mu-tation, should disrupt the IGPS allosteric network. The demon-strated importance of the networks suggests these mutations will alter the protein dynamics and that the resulting changes to the dynamical network will affect the corresponding functional prop-erties of the enzyme. The prior community network analysis showed that a feature of PRFAR binding is the strengthening of some communities at the expense of others, which involved multiple residues switching be-tween communities. (25) In particular, there was an increase in communication between the HisF community, f3{$\prime$}, which contained secondary-structure elements f{$\beta$}1, f{$\beta$}2, f{$\beta$}3, f{$\beta$}4, f{$\alpha$}2, f{$\alpha$}2, and h{$\alpha$}1, and community h2{$\prime$}, which encompassed the glutaminase active site and hP10 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). This community connectivity is the most correlated route of communication between HisF and HisH. Throughout the manuscript, we distinguish HisF and HisH residues and communities with lowercase f and h, respectively. Additional community interactions in the PRFAR activated state occurred between community f3{$\prime$} and f4{$\prime$}, which include residues from f{$\beta$}1, f{$\beta$}2, f{$\alpha$}1, and loop 1. To examine the impact of pertur-bations to these allosteric communities and pathways, we engi-neered four IGPS variants (V12A, K19A, V48A, and D98A) that introduce an alanine residue at crucial positions within HisF (Fig. 1) but distant to the PRFAR binding site. The first residue, V12 in f{$\beta$}1, represents a residue from the apo community, f3 that switches to f1{$\prime$} in the allosterically activated enzyme. In this PRFAR acti-vated state, the f1{$\prime$} community forms a weak network with the glutaminase community h2{$\prime$}. The second residue, K19, is located in loop 1, in the apo community f3, and switches to the f4{$\prime$} community in the PRFAR-bound state. The third residue, V48, is located in},

The method bypasses the poor scaling with system size of standard replica exchange and thus reduces the number of replicas (parallel processes) that must be used. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST is compared with standard replica exchange for an alanine dipeptide molecule in water. The comparisons confirm that REST greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and increases the sampling efficiency. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water. {\copyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

We here study at atomic detail the allosteric regulation of CAP with Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We recover the experimentally observed entropic penalty for the second cAMP binding event with our recently developed force covariance entropy estimator and reveal allosteric communication pathways with Force Distribution Analyses (FDA). Our observations show that CAP binding results in characteristic changes in the interaction pathways connecting the two cAMP allosteric binding sites with each other, as well as with the DNA binding domains. We identified crucial relays in the mostly symmetric allosteric activation network, and suggest point mutants to test this mechanism. Our study suggests inter-residue forces, as opposed to coordinates, as a highly sensitive measure for structural adaptations that, even though minute, can very effectively propagate allosteric signals.},

  abstract = {In aqueous solution, solute conformational transitions are governed by intimate interplays of the fluctuations of solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water interactions. To promote molecular fluctuations to enhance sampling of essential conformational changes, a common strategy is to construct an expanded Hamiltonian through a series of Hamiltonian perturbations and thereby broaden the distribution of certain interactions of focus. Due to a lack of active sampling of configuration response to Hamiltonian transitions, it is challenging for common expanded Hamil-tonian methods to robustly explore solvent mediated rare conformational events. The orthogonal space sampling (OSS) scheme, as exemplified by the orthogonal space random walk and orthogonal space tempering methods, provides a general framework for synchronous acceleration of slow configuration responses. To more effectively sample conformational transitions in aqueous solution, in this work, we devised a generalized orthogonal space tempering (gOST) algorithm. Specifically, in the Hamiltonian perturbation part, a solvent-accessible-surface-area-dependent term is introduced to implicitly perturb near-solute water-water fluctuations; more importantly in the orthogonal space response part, the generalized force order parameter is generalized as a two-dimension order parameter set, in which essential solute-solvent and solute-solute components are separately treated. The gOST algorithm is evaluated through a molecular dynamics simulation study on the explicitly solvated deca-alanine (Ala 10) peptide. On the basis of a fully automated sampling protocol, the gOST simulation enabled repetitive folding and unfolding of the solvated peptide within a single continuous trajectory and allowed for detailed constructions of Ala 10 folding/unfolding free energy surfaces. The gOST result reveals that solvent cooperative fluctuations play a pivotal role in Ala 10 folding/unfolding transitions. In addition, our assessment analysis suggests that because essential conformational events are mainly driven by the compensating fluctuations of essential solute-solvent and solute-solute interactions, commonly employed " predictive " sampling methods are unlikely to be effective on this seemingly " simple " system. The gOST development presented in this paper illustrates how to employ the OSS scheme for physics-based sampling method designs.},

A system for which such behavior has been widely discussed is the PDZ2 domain of human tyrosine phosphatase 1E. Here, we present results from equilibrium trajectories of the PDZ2 domain in the free and ligand-bound state, as well as nonequilibrium simulations of the relaxation of PDZ2 after removal of its peptide ligand. The study reveals changes in inter-residue contacts, backbone dihedral angles, and C{$\alpha$} positions upon ligand release. Our findings show a long-range conformational response of the PDZ2 domain to ligand release in the form of a collective shift of the secondary structure elements {$\alpha$}2, {$\beta$}2, {$\beta$}3, {$\alpha$}1- {$\beta$}4, and the C terminal loop relative to the rest of the protein away from the N-terminus, and a shift of the loops {$\beta$}2-{$\beta$}3 and {$\beta$}1-{$\beta$}2 in the opposite direction. The shifts lead to conformational changes in the backbone, especially in the {$\beta$}2-{$\beta$}3 loop but also in the {$\beta$}5-{$\alpha$}2 and the {$\alpha$}2-{$\beta$}6 loop, and are accompanied by changes of inter-residue contacts mainly within the {$\beta$}2-{$\beta$}3 loop as well as between the {$\alpha$}2 helix and other segments. The residues showing substantial changes of inter-residue contacts, backbone conformations, or C{$\alpha$} positions are considered ``key residues'' for the long-range conformational response of PDZ2. By comparing these residues with various sets of residues highlighted by previous studies of PDZ2, we investigate the statistical correlation of the various approaches. Interestingly, we find a considerable correlation of our findings with several works considering structural changes but no significant correlations with approaches considering energy flow or networks based on inter-residue energies.},

This perspective first outlines the evolution of the allosteric concept and describes the advantages and hurdles facing allosteric modulator discovery. The current available computational approaches, together with experimental approaches aiming to highlight allosteric studies, are then highlighted, emphasizing successful examples with their combined applications.

Supercooled liquids and frozen glasses are truly frustrated systems whose microscopic dynamics consist of cooperative motions, high in the energy spectrum of structural states, and well above the defect states of an ordered solid. There is a temperature below which activated processes dominate dynamics and thus a free energy landscape emerges, many of whose microscopic attributes can be computed. In addition to signature phenomena in supercooled liquids, we apply this microscopic picture to the phenomenon of slaving of large scale conformational changes of a folded protein, imbedded in a glass-forming solvent, to the solvent motions. The size of the basin encompassing the corresponding conformational substates will be deduced, based on kinetic measurements alone. Implications of the theory for interpreting computer simulations of glass-forming systems are discussed. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Proteins need to be tightly regulated as they control biological processes in most normal cellular functions. The precise mechanisms of regulation are rarely completely understood but can involve binding of endogenous ligands and/or partner proteins at specific locations on a protein that can modulate function. Often, these additional secondary binding sites appear separate to the primary binding site, which, for example for an enzyme, may bind a substrate. In previous work, we have uncovered several examples in which secondary binding sites were discovered on proteins using fragment screening approaches. In each case, we were able to establish that the newly identified secondary binding site was biologically relevant as it was able to modulate function by the binding of a small molecule. In this study, we investigate how often secondary binding sites are located on proteins by analyzing 24 protein targets for which we have performed a fragment screen using X-ray crystallography. Our analysis shows that, surprisingly, the majority of proteins contain secondary binding sites based on their ability to bind fragments. Furthermore, sequence analysis of these previously unknown sites indicate high conservation, which suggests that they may have a biological function, perhaps via an allosteric mechanism. Comparing the physicochemical properties of the secondary sites with known primary ligand binding sites also shows broad similarities indicating that many of the secondary sites may be druggable in nature with small molecules that could provide new opportunities to modulate potential therapeutic targets.},

Based on our established efficient synthetic sequence, a series of inhibitors for Plm II and IV has been synthesized bearing a 2,3,4,7-tetrahydro-1H-azepine scaffold as the core structural element. During the computational design cycle, thorough investigations were carried out in order to find a reasonable theoretical binding mode for Plm II and IV. The conformation of Plm II in the crystal structure (PDB code: 1LF2) provides a good starting geometry for our virtual screening approach. In contrast, the only available co-crystal structure for Plm IV of P. falciparum (PDB code: 1LS5) appears inappropriate for inhibitor design. Therefore, a homology model was constructed based on the Plm II 1LF2 structure. A combinatorial docking run using FlexXc suggested compounds which, after synthesis, turned out to exhibit affinities in the sub-micromolar range. The observed structure-activity relationships of the synthesized compounds confirm the assumed binding mode for Plm II and IV.

  abstract = {In aqueous solution, solute conformational transitions are governed by intimate interplays of the fluctuations of solute--solute, solute--water, and water--water interactions. To promote molecular fluctuations to enhance sampling of essential conformational changes, a common strategy is to construct an expanded Hamiltonian through a series of Hamiltonian perturbations and thereby broaden the distribution of certain interactions of focus. Due to a lack of active sampling of configuration response to Hamiltonian transitions, it is challenging for common expanded Hamiltonian methods to robustly explore solvent mediated rare conformational events. The orthogonal space sampling (OSS) scheme, as exemplified by the orthogonal space random walk and orthogonal space tempering methods, provides a general framework for synchronous acceleration of slow configuration responses. To more effectively sample conformational transitions in aqueous solution, in this work, we devised a generalized orthogonal space tempering (gOST) algorithm. Specifically, in the Hamiltonian perturbation part, a solvent-accessible-surface-area-dependent term is introduced to implicitly perturb near-solute water--water fluctuations; more importantly in the orthogonal space response part, the generalized force order parameter is generalized as a two-dimension order parameter set, in which essential solute--solvent and solute--solute components are separately treated. The gOST algorithm is evaluated through a molecular dynamics simulation study on the explicitly solvated deca-alanine (Ala10) peptide. On the basis of a fully automated sampling protocol, the gOST simulation enabled repetitive folding and unfolding of the solvated peptide within a single continuous trajectory and allowed for detailed constructions of Ala10 folding/unfolding free energy surfaces. The gOST result reveals that solvent cooperative fluctuations play a pivotal role in Ala10 folding/unfolding transitions. In addition, our assessment analysis suggests that because essential conformational events are mainly driven by the compensating fluctuations of essential solute--solvent and solute--solute interactions, commonly employed ``predictive'' sampling methods are unlikely to be effective on this seemingly ``simple'' system. The gOST development presented in this paper illustrates how to employ the OSS scheme for physics-based sampling method designs.},

To overcome the diffusion sampling issue, which reveals the fact that enlargement of event-irrelevant energy fluctuations may abolish sampling efficiency, the essential energy space random walk (EESRW) approach was proposed earlier. To more effectively accelerate the sampling of solute conformations in aqueous environment, in the current work, we generalized the EESRW method to a two-dimension-EESRW (2D-EESRW) strategy. Specifically, the essential internal energy component of a focused region and the essential interaction energy component between the focused region and the environmental region are employed to define the two-dimensional essential energy space. This proposal is motivated by the general observation that in different conformational events, the two essential energy components have distinctive interplays. Model studies on the alanine dipeptide and the aspartate-arginine peptide demonstrate sampling improvement over the original one-dimension-EESRW strategy; with the same biasing level, the present generalization allows more effective acceleration of the sampling of conformational transitions in aqueous solution. The 2D-EESRW generalization is readily extended to higher dimension schemes and employed in more advanced enhanced-sampling schemes, such as the recent orthogonal space random walk method.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2016 American Chemical Society.Allostery is the phenomenon in which a ligand binding at one site affects other sites in the same macromolecule. Allostery has important roles in many biological processes. Theoretically, all nonfibrous proteins are potentially allosteric. However, few allosteric proteins have been validated, and the identification of novel allosteric sites remains a challenge. The motion of residues and subunits underlies protein function; therefore, we hypothesized that the motions of allosteric and orthosteric sites are correlated. We utilized a data set of 24 known allosteric sites from 23 monomer proteins to calculate the correlations between potential ligand-binding sites and corresponding orthosteric sites using a Gaussian network model (GNM). Most of the known allosteric site motions showed high correlations with corresponding orthosteric site motions, whereas other surface cavities did not. These high correlations were robust when using different structural data for the same protein, such as structures for the apo state and the orthosteric effector-binding state, whereas the contributions of different frequency modes to motion correlations depend on the given protein. The high correlations between allosteric and orthosteric site motions were also observed in oligomeric allosteric proteins. We applied motion correlation analysis to predict potential allosteric sites in the 23 monomer proteins, and some of these predictions were in good agreement with published experimental data. We also performed motion correlation analysis to identify a novel allosteric site in 15-lipoxygenase (an enzyme in the arachidonic acid metabolic network) using recently reported activating compounds. Our analysis correctly identified this novel allosteric site along with two other sites that are currently under experimental investigation. Our study demonstrates that the motions of allosteric sites are highly correlated with the motions of orthosteric sites. Our correlation analysis method provides new tools for predicting potential allosteric sites.}

Only sporadic cases of ESBL-producing E. cloacae have been identified in our hospital in recent years. We describe the epidemiology and clinical and microbiological characteristics of an outbreak caused by ESBL-producing E. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CT-ICU). Prospective surveillance of patients with infection or colonization by ESBL-producing E. cloacae among patients admitted to the CT-ICU was performed during the outbreak. Production of ESBL was determined by decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a positive double-disk test result. Clone relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). From July to September 2005, seven patients in the CT-ICU with ESBL-producing E. cloacae were identified (four males; median age, 73 years; range, 45 to 76 years); six patients had cardiac surgery. Four patients developed infections; three had primary bacteremia, one had ventilator-associated pneumonia, and one had tracheobronchitis. ESBL- producing E. cloacae showed resistance to quinolones and aminoglycosides. PFGE revealed two patterns. Five isolates belonged to clone A; two carried a single ESBL (pI 8.2 and a positive PCR result for the SHV type), and three carried two ESBLs (pIs 8.1 and 8.2 and positive PCR results for the SHV and CTX-M-9 types). Isolates belonging to clone B carried a single ESBL (pI 5.4 and a positive PCR result for theTEMtype). Review of antibiotic consumption showed increased use of cefepime and quinolones during June and July 2005. The outbreak was stopped by the implementation of barrier measures and cephalosporin restriction. ESBL production could be increasingly common in nosocomial pathogens other than Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.},

  abstract = {A computational technique is proposed which combines the string method with a sampling technique to determine minimum free energy paths. The technique only requires to compute the mean force and another conditional expectation locally along the string, and therefore can be applied even if the number of collective variables kept in the free energy calculation is large. This is in contrast with other free energy sampling techniques which aim at mapping the full free energy landscape and whose cost increases exponentially with the number of collective variables kept in the free energy. Provided that the number of collective variables is large enough, the new technique captures the mechanism of transition in that it allows to determine the committor function for the reaction and, in particular, the transition state region. The new technique is illustrated on the example of alanine dipeptide, in which we compute the minimum free energy path for the isomerization transition using either two or four dihedral angles as collective variables. It is shown that the mechanism of transition can be captured using the four dihedral angles, but it cannot be captured using only two of them.},

  abstract = {This study deals with a novel molecular simulation technique, named adiabatic bias molecular dynamics (MD), which provides a simple and reasonably inexpensive route to generate MD trajectories joining points in conformational space separated by activation barriers. Because of the judicious way the biasing potential is updated during the MD runs, the technique allows with some additional effort the computation of the free energy change experienced during the trajectory. The adiabatic bias method has been applied to a nontrivial problem: The unfolding of an atomistic model of lysozyme. Here, the radius of gyration (Rg) was used as a convenient reaction coordinate. For changes in Rg between 19.7 and 28 {\AA}, we observe a net loss of the native tertiary structure of lysozyme. At the same time, secondary structure elements such as {$\alpha$}-helices are retained although some of the original order is diminished. The calculated free energy profile for the unfolding transition shows a monotonous increase with Rg and depends crucially on the nonbonded cutoff used in the potential model. {\copyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.}

Being based on Shannon entropies, this model-free approach in principle allows us to detect statistical dependencies of all types, i.e. linear and nonlinear temporal correlations. However, when available data is limited and the expected effect is rather small, a straightforward implementation suffers badly from misestimation due to finite sample effects, making it basically impossible to assess the significance of the obtained values. We therefore introduce a modified estimator, called effective transfer entropy , which leads to improved results in such conditions. In the application, we then manage to confirm an information transfer on a time scale of one minute between the two financial time series. The different economic impact of the two indices is also recovered from the data. Numerical results are then interpreted on one hand as capability of one index to explain future observations of the other, and on the other hand within terms of coupling strengths in the framework of a bivariate autoregressive stochastic model. Evidence is given for a nonlinear character of the coupling between Dow Jones and DAX.}

The hydrogen bonding structure in the different simulated states as well as the influence of the hydrogen bonds on the dynamic properties (self-diffusion coefficients, vibrational spectra) is discussed. Special attention is paid to the intermolecular vibrational spectrum (10--400 cm-1). It has been corroborated that the band around 200 cm-1 can be attributed to intermolecular O--O stretching vibrations of pairs of H-bonded bounded molecules. On the contrary, molecular dynamics results indicate that the band close to 50 cm-1 is independent of the existence of hydrogen bonds but depends on the density and temperature of the system. It is suggested that it is simply associated with vibrations of molecules in the cage formed by their neighbors. Shifts of librational and stretching bands as a function of the thermodynamic state are highly correlated with changes in the percentage of hydrogen bonded molecules.},

The probability and lifetime of H-bonds that break either by translational or librational motions and those of energetic broken H-bonds, along with the effects of transient broken H-bonds and transient H-bonds, are considered. We show that the fraction of transiently broken energetic H-bonds increases at low temperatures and that this energetic breakdown is caused by oxygen?oxygen electrostatic repulsions upon too small amplitude librations to disrupt geometric H-bonds. Hence, differences between geometric and energetic continuous H-bond lifetimes are associated with large H-bond energy fluctuations, in opposition to moderate geometric fluctuations, within common energetic and geometric H-bond definition thresholds. Exclusion of transient broken H-bonds and transient H-bonds leads to H-bond definition-independent mean lifetimes and activation energies, ?11 kJ/mol, consistent with the reactive flux method and experimental scattering results. Further, we show that power law decay of specific temporal H-bond lifetime probability distributions is associated with librational and translational motions that occur on the time scale (?0.1 ps) of H-bond breaking /re-forming dynamics. While our analysis is diffusion-free, the effect of diffusion on H-bond probability distributions where H-bonds are allowed to break and re-form, switching acceptors in between, is shown to result in neither exponential nor power law decay, similar to the reactive flux correlation function.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE:G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of therapeutically important proteins and as diverse X-ray structures become available it is increasingly possible to leverage structural information for rational drug design.We present herein approaches that use explicit water networks combined with energetic surveys of the binding site (GRID), providing an enhanced druggability and ligand design approach, with structural understanding of ligand binding, including a 'magic' methyl and binding site mutations, and a fast new approach to generate and score waters.METHODS:The GRID program was used to identify lipophilic and hydrogen bonding hotspots. Explicit full water networks were generated and scored for (pseudo)apo structures and ligand-protein complexes using a new approach, WaterFLAP (Molecular Discovery), together with WaterMap (Schrodinger) for (pseudo)apo structures. A scoring function (MetaScore) was developed using a fast computational protocol based on several short adiabatic biased MD simulations followed by multiple short well-tempered metadynamics runs.RESULTS:Analysis of diverse ligands binding to the adenosine A2A receptor together with new structures for the delta/kappa/mu opioid and CCR5 receptors confirmed the key role of lipophilic hotspots in driving ligand binding and thus design; the displacement of 'unhappy' waters generally found in these regions provides a key binding energy component. Complete explicit water networks could be robustly generated for protein-ligand complexes using a WaterFLAP based approach. They provide a structural understanding of structure-activity relationships such as a 'magic methyl' effect and with the metadynamics approach a useful estimation of the binding energy changes resulting from active site mutations.CONCLUSIONS:The promise of full structure-based drug design (SBDD) for GPCRs is now possible using a combination of advanced experimental and computational data. The conformational thermostabilisation of StaR(R) proteins provide the ability to easily generate biophysical screening data (binding including fragments, kinetics) and to get crystal structures with both potent and weak ligands. Explicit water networks for apo and ligand-complex structures are a critical 'third dimension' for SBDD and are key for understanding ligand binding energies and kinetics. GRID lipophilic hotspots are found to be key drivers for binding. In this context 'high end' GPCR ligand design is now enabled.},

Because of structural similarities with H2O, it was hypothesized that aquaporins may facilitate H2S transport across cell membranes. We tested this hypothesis by reconstituting the archeal aquaporin AfAQP from sulfide reducing bacteria Archaeoglobus fulgidus into planar membranes and by monitoring the resulting facilitation of osmotic water flow and H2S flux. To measure H2O and H2S fluxes, respectively, sodium ion dilution and buffer acidification by proton release (H2S ⇆ H++ HS-) were recorded in the immediate membrane vicinity. Both sodium ion concentration and pH were measured by scanning ion-selective microelectrodes. A lower limit of lipid bilayer permeability to H2S, PM,H2S{$>$} 0.5 {\textpm} 0.4 cm/s was calculated by numerically solving the complete system of differential reaction diffusion equations and fitting the theoretical pH distribution to experimental pH profiles. Even though reconstitution of AfAQP significantly increased water permeability through planar lipid bilayers, PM,H2Sremained unchanged. These results indicate that lipid membranes may well act as a barrier to water transport although they do not oppose a significant resistance to H2S diffusion. The fact that cholesterol and sphingomyelin reconstitution did not turn these membranes into an H2S barrier indicates that H2S transport through epithelial barriers, endothelial barriers, and membrane rafts also occurs by simple diffusion and does not require facilitation by membrane channels.},

This is the first structure for an acyl-enzyme intermediate with a substrate reported for a native class A beta-lactamase. This compound was designed and synthesized as a molecule that would acylate the active site of the enzyme, but would resist deacylation by virtue of the fact that its C-6 alpha hydroxymethyl moiety was expected to occupy the space near the hydrolytic water molecule (J. Am. Chem. Sec. 1995, 117, 11055), The crystal structure of the acyl-enzyme species is closely similar to one of the two energy-minimized acyl-enzyme models generated in the course of the design aspect of the work. The crystal structure provides evidence for a number of mechanistic features for the inhibition process and the ultimate recovery of the activity. Our results reported herein are consistent with the side-chain carboxylate of Glu-166 being the active-site basic function that activates the hydrolytic water for the deacylation step in the course of catalysis by class A beta-lactamases.

  abstract = {Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, including expenditure from spontaneous physical activity (SPA). Changes in SPA and resulting changes in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) likely interact with diet to influence risk for obesity. However, previous research on the relationship between diet, physical activity, and energy expenditure has been mixed. The neuropeptide orexin is a driver of SPA, and orexin neuron activity can be manipulated using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs). We hypothesized that HFD decreases SPA and NEAT, and that DREADD-mediated activation of orexin neuron signaling would abolish this decrease and produce an increase in NEAT instead. To test these ideas, we characterized behaviors to determine the extent to which access to a high-fat diet (HFD) influences the proportion and probability of engaging in food intake and activity. We then measured NEAT following access to HFD and following a DREADD intervention targeting orexin neurons. Two cohorts of orexin-cre male mice were injected with an excitatory DREADD virus into the caudal hypothalamus, where orexin neurons are concentrated. Mice were then housed in continuous metabolic phenotyping cages (Sable Promethion). Food intake, indirect calorimetry, and SPA were automatically measured every second. For cohort 1 (n = 8), animals were given access to chow, then switched to HFD. For cohort 2 (n = 4/group), half of the animals were given access to HFD, the other access to chow. Then, among animals on HFD, orexin neurons were activated following injections of clozapine n-oxide (CNO). Mice on HFD spent significantly less time eating (p {$<$} 0.01) and more time inactive compared to mice on chow (p {$<$} 0.01). Following a meal, mice on HFD were significantly more likely to engage in periods of inactivity compared to those on chow (p {$<$} 0.05). NEAT was decreased in animals on HFD, and was increased to the NEAT level of control animals following activation of orexin neurons with DREADDs. Food intake (kilocalories) was not significantly different between mice on chow and HFD, yet mice on chow expended more energy per unit of SPA, relative to that in mice consuming HFD. These results suggest that HFD consumption reduces SPA and NEAT, and increases inactivity following a meal. Together, the data suggest a change in the efficiency of energy expenditure based upon diet, such that SPA during HFD burns fewer calories compared to SPA on a standard chow diet.},

Although the release of generalized versions of common classical force fields, for example, General Amber Force Field and CHARMM General Force Field, have posited guidelines for parameterization of small molecules, many technical challenges remain that have hampered their wide-scale extension. The Force Field Toolkit (ffTK), described herein, minimizes common barriers to ligand parameterization through algorithm and method development, automation of tedious and error-prone tasks, and graphical user interface design. Distributed as a VMD plugin, ffTK facilitates the traversal of a clear and organized workflow resulting in a complete set of CHARMM-compatible parameters. A variety of tools are provided to generate quantum mechanical target data, setup multidimensional optimization routines, and analyze parameter performance. Parameters developed for a small test set of molecules using ffTK were comparable to existing CGenFF parameters in their ability to reproduce experimentally measured values for pure-solvent properties ({$<$}15\% error from experiment) and free energy of solvation ({\textpm}0.5 kcal/mol from experiment). {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Clavulanate, an inhibitor for beta-lactamases, was the very first inhibitor for an antibiotic resistance enzyme that found clinical utility in 1985. The clinical use of clavulanate and that of sulbactam and tazobactam, which were introduced to the clinic subsequently, has facilitated evolution of a set of beta-lactamases that not only retain their original function as resistance enzymes but also are refractory to inhibition by the inhibitors. This article characterizes the properties of the clinically identified M69L mutant variant of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli, an inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase, and compares it to the wild-type enzyme. The enzyme is as active as the wild-type in turnover of typical beta-lactam antibiotics. Furthermore, many of the parameters for interactions of the inhibitors with the mutant enzyme are largely unaffected. The significant effect of the inhibitor-resistant trait was a relatively modest elevation of the dissociation constant for the formation of the pre-acylation complex. The high-resolution X-ray crystal structure for the M69L mutant variant revealed essentially no alteration of the three-dimensional structure, both for the protein backbone and for the positions of the side chains of the amino acids. It was surmised that the difference in the two enzymes must reside with the dynamic motions of the two proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations of the mutant and wild-type proteins were carried out for 2 ns each. Dynamic cross-correlated maps revealed the collective motions of the two proteins to be very similar, yet the two proteins did not behave identically. Differences in behavior of the two proteins existed in the regions between residues 145-179 and 155-162. Additional calculations revealed that kinetic effects measured experimentally for the dissociation constant for the pre-acylation complex could be mostly attributed to the electrostatic and van der Waals components of the binding free energy. The effects of the mutation on the behavior of the beta-lactamase were subtle, including the differences in the measured dissociation constants that account for the inhibitor-resistant trait. It would appear that nature has selected for incorporation of the most benign alteration in the structure of the wild-type TEM-1 beta-lactamase that is sufficient to give the inhibitor-resistant trait.},

Given their use in medicinal chemistry, there are surprisingly few substantial series of congeneric ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Here we determine the structures of eight alkyl benzenes, in single-methylene increases from benzene to n-hexylbenzene, bound to an enclosed cavity in T4 lysozyme. The volume of the apo cavity suffices to accommodate benzene but, even with toluene, larger cavity conformations become observable in the electron density, and over the series two other major conformations are observed. These involve discrete changes in main-chain conformation, expanding the site; few continuous changes in the site are observed. In most structures, two discrete protein conformations are observed simultaneously, and energetic considerations suggest that these conformations are low in energy relative to the ground state. An analysis of 121 lysozyme cavity structures in the PDB finds that these three conformations dominate the previously determined structures, largely modeled in a single conformation. An investigation of the few congeneric series in the PDB suggests that discrete changes are common adaptations to a series of growing ligands. The discrete, but relatively few, conformational states observed here, and their energetic accessibility, may have implications for anticipating protein conformational change in ligand design.},

Here, using molecular dynamics simulation, we provide an explanation of recent x-ray and neutron solution scattering data that indicate that the density of water on the surface of lysozyme is significantly higher than that of bulk water. The simulation-derived scattering profiles are in excellent agreement with the experiment. In the simulation, the 3-{\AA}-thick first hydration layer is 15\% denser than bulk water. About two-thirds of this increase is the result of a geometric contribution that would also be present if the water was unperturbed from the bulk. The remaining third arises from modification of the water structure and dynamics, involving approximately equal contributions from shortening of the average water-water O-O distance and an increase in the coordination number. Variation in the first hydration shell density is shown to be determined by topographical and electrostatic properties of the protein surface. On average, denser water is found in depressions on the surface in which the water dipoles tend to be aligned parallel to each other by the electrostatic field generated by the protein atoms.}

  abstract = {Design of ligands that provide receptor selectivity has emerged as a new paradigm for drug discovery of G protein-coupled receptors, and may, for certain families of receptors, only be achieved via identification of chemically diverse allosteric modulators. Here, the extracellular vestibule of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is targeted for structure-based design of allosteric modulators. Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations were performed to construct structural ensembles that account for the receptor flexibility. Compounds obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) were docked to the receptor ensembles. Retrospective docking of known ligands showed that combining aMD simulations with Glide induced fit docking (IFD) provided much-improved enrichment factors, compared with the Glide virtual screening workflow. Glide IFD was thus applied in receptor ensemble docking, and 38 top-ranked NCI compounds were selected for experimental testing. In [3H]N-methylscopolamine radioligand dissociation assays, approximately half of the 38 lead compounds altered the radioligand dissociation rate, a hallmark of allosteric behavior. In further competition binding experiments, we identified 12 compounds with affinity of {$\leq$}30 {$\mu$}M. With final functional experiments on six selected compounds, we confirmed four of them as new negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) and one as positive allosteric modulatorofagonist-mediated response at the M2 mAChR. Two of the NAMs showed subtype selectivity without significant effect at the M1 and M3 mAChRs. This study demonstrates an unprecedented successful structure-based approach to identify chemically diverse and selective GPCR allosteric modulators with outstanding potential for further structure-activity relationship studies.},

  abstract = {Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene ({\textasciitilde}106 M-1s-1). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 {$\mu$}s trajectories, identifies and quantifies multiple ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up multiple pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a single dominant pathway for ligand binding.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2017 Author(s). Since the pioneering works of Pethig, Grant, and W{\"u}thrich on a protein hydration layer, many studies have been devoted to find out if there are any "general and universal" characteristic features that can distinguish water molecules inside the protein hydration layer from bulk. Given that the surface itself varies from protein to protein, and that each surface facing the water is heterogeneous, search for universal features has been elusive. Here, we perform an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation in order to propose and demonstrate that such defining characteristics can emerge if we look not at average properties but the distribution of relaxation times. We present results of calculations of distributions of residence times and rotational relaxation times for four different protein-water systems and compare them with the same quantities in the bulk. The distributions in the hydration layer are unusually broad and log-normal in nature due to the simultaneous presence of peptide backbones that form weak hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic amino acid side chains that form no hydrogen bond, and charged polar groups that form a strong hydrogen bond with the surrounding water molecules. The broad distribution is responsible for the non-exponential dielectric response and also agrees with large specific heat of the hydration water. Our calculations reveal that while the average time constant is just about 2-3 times larger than that of bulk water, it provides a poor representation of the real behaviour. In particular, the average leads to the erroneous conclusion that water in the hydration layer is bulk-like. However, the observed and calculated lower value of static dielectric constant of hydration layer remained difficult to reconcile with the broad distribution observed in dynamical properties. We offer a plausible explanation of these unique properties.},

Because these changes have been studied by comparison of structures from different species, which share approximately one-third of their residues, only rough descriptions have been possible to date. Results We have solved the structure of unligated adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli at 2.2 {\aa} resolution and compared it with the high-resolution structure of the same enzyme ligated with an inhibitor mimicking both substrates, ATP and AMP. This comparison shows that, upon substrate binding, the enzyme increases its chain mobility in a region remote from the active center. As this region `solidifies' again on substrate release, we propose that it serves as a `counterweight' balancing the substrate binding energy. Conclusion The comparison of two very different conformations of the same polypeptide chain revealed kinematic details of the catalytic cycle. Moreover, it indicated that there exists an energetic counterweight compensating the substrate binding energy required for specificity. This counterweight prevents the enzyme from dropping into a rate-reducing energy well along the reaction coordinate.},

To understand the catalytic mechanism of N-carbamyl-D-amino acid hydrolysis, the substrate specificity and thermostability of the enzyme, we have determined the structure of DCase from Agrobacterium sp. strain KNK712. Results: The crystal structure of DCase has been determined to 1.7 {\AA} resolution. The enzyme forms a homotetramer and each monomer consists of a variant of the {$\alpha$}+{$\beta$} fold. The topology of the enzyme comprises a sandwich of parallel {$\beta$} sheets surrounded by two layers of {$\alpha$} helices, this topology has not been observed in other amidohydrolases such as the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases. Conclusions: The catalytic center could be identified and consists of Glu46, Lys126 and Cys 171. Cys 171 was found to be the catalytic nucleophile, and its nucleophilic character appeared to be increased through general-base activation by Glu46. DCase shows only weak sequence similarity with a family of amidohydrolases, including {$\beta$}-alanine synthase, aliphatic amidases and nitrilases, but might share highly conserved residues in a novel framework, which could provide a possible explanation for the catalytic mechanism for this family of enzymes.},

The tetrahedral hydrogen-bond geometry of water molecules in bulk solvent was retained at the interface and enabled the extension of a three-dimensional chain connection of a hydrogen-bond network among hydration water molecules and polar protein atoms over the entire surface of proteins. Networks of hydrogen bonds were quite flexible to accommodate and/or to regulate the conformational changes of proteins such as domain motions.

Here, we critically examine the statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in molecular simulations of two amino acid side-chain analogs, leucine and arginine, in the presence of a hydrated phospholipid bilayer. To this end, the convergence of the standard binding free energy for the reversible insertion of the solutes in the bilayer is systematically assessed by evaluating dozens of separate sets of umbrella sampling calculations for a total simulation time exceeding 400 {$\mu$}s. We identify rare and abrupt transitions in bilayer structure as a function of solute insertion depth. These transitions correspond to the slow reorganization of ionic interactions involving zwitterionic phospholipid headgroups when the solutes penetrate the lipid-water interface and when arginine is forced through the bilayer center. These rare events are shown to constitute hidden sampling barriers that limit the rate of convergence of equilibrium properties and result in systematic sampling errors. Our analysis demonstrates that the difficulty of attaining convergence for lipid bilayer-embedded solutes has, in general, been drastically underestimated. This information will assist future studies in improving accuracy by selecting a more appropriate reaction coordinate or by focusing computational resources on those regions of the reaction coordinate that exhibit slow convergence of equilibrium properties. {\copyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.}

  abstract = {Hydrated proteins undergo a change in their dynamical properties in the neighborhood of a temperature. The change of dynamics has been likened to glass transition of glass-forming substances because similar properties were found. However, a complete understanding of the conformation fluctuations of hydrated proteins and their relation to the dynamics of the solvent is still not available, possibly due to the protein molecules being more complex than ordinary glass-formers. For this reason, we turn our attention to the experimental findings of the dynamics of mixtures of water with simpler glass-formers (small molecules and polymers). Two major relaxation processes have been observed in these aqueous mixtures. One is the structural alpha-relaxation of the hydrophilic glass-former hydrogen bonded to the water, which is responsible for glass transition. The other one is the local secondary beta-relaxation of water in the mixture. Remarkably, these two relaxation processes in aqueous mixtures have analogues in hydrated proteins with the same properties. The conformation fluctuations of the protein and the relaxation of the solvent in hydrated proteins behave like the alpha-relaxation of the hydrophilic glass-former hydrogen bonded to the water and the beta-relaxation of water in other aqueous mixtures, respectively. At low temperatures, the Arrhenius activation energy of the relaxation time of the solvent in a hydrated protein is almost the same as that of the beta-relaxation of water in the glassy states of aqueous mixtures. The Arrhenius T-dependence of the solvent relaxation times no longer holds at temperatures that exceed the "glass" transition temperature of the hydrated protein, defined as the temperature at which the conformation relaxation time is very long. This behavior of the solvent in hydrated proteins is similar to that found in the beta-relaxation of water in aqueous mixtures when crossing the glass transition temperature of the mixture (Capaccioli, S.; Ngai, K. L.; Shinyashiki, N. J. Phys. Chem. B 2007, 111, 8197). Furthermore, the same dynamics were found in mixtures of two van der Waals glass-formers, which are even simpler systems than aqueous mixtures because of the absence of hydrogen bonding. The experimental data of these ideal mixtures of van der Waals glass-formers have been given a satisfactory theoretical explanation. Since the properties of hydrated proteins, aqueous mixtures, and the mixtures of van der Waals liquids are similar, we transfer the theoretical understanding gained in the study of the last system sequentially to the two other increasingly more complex systems.},

All atom molecular dynamics simulations in water and multiple long trajectories, for a cumulative time of 6.9 {$\mu$}s, show that the oligomer grows by a two-stage dock-lock mechanism. The largest conformational change in the added disordered monomer occurs during the rapid ({$\approx$} 50 ns) first dock stage in which the {$\beta$}-strand content of the monomer increases substantially from a low initial value. In the second slow-lock phase, the monomer rearranges to form in register antiparallel structures. Surprisingly, the mobile structured oligomers undergo large conformational changes in order to accommodate the added monomer. The time needed to incorporate the monomer into the fluid-like oligomer grows even when n = 6, which suggests that the critical nucleus size must exceed six. Stable antiparallel structure formation exceeds hundreds of nanoseconds even though frequent interpeptide collisions occur at elevated monomer concentrations used in the simulations. The dock-lock mechanism should be a generic mechanism for growth of oligomers of amyloidogenic peptides. {\copyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Snapshots from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies, energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host's nonpolar cavity. Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions. {\copyright} 2012, American Institute of Physics.

  abstract = {In life science, water is the ubiquitous solvent, sometimes even called the "matrix of life". There is increasing experimental and theoretical evidence that solvation water is not a passive spectator in biomolecular processes. New experimental techniques can quantify how water interacts with biomolecules and, in doing so, differs from "bulk" water. Terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy has turned out to be a powerful tool to study (bio)molecular hydration. The main concepts that have been developed in the recent years to describe the underlying solute-induced sub-picosecond dynamics of the hydration shell are discussed herein. Moreover, we highlight recent findings that show the significance of hydrogen bond dynamics for the function of antifreeze proteins and for molecular recognition. In all of these examples, a gradient of water motion toward functional sites of proteins is observed, the so-called "hydration funnel". By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we provide new evidence for a specific water-protein coupling as the cause of the observed dynamical heterogeneity. The efficiency of the coupling at THz frequencies is explained in terms of a two-tier (short- and long-range) solute-solvent interaction.},

  abstract = {Ligand binding can change the pKa of protein residues and influence enzyme catalysis. Herein, we report three ultrahigh resolution X-ray crystal structures of CTX-M ?-lactamase, directly visualizing protonation state changes along the enzymatic pathway: apo protein at 0.79 {\AA}, precovalent complex with nonelectrophilic ligand at 0.89 {\AA}, and acylation transition state (TS) analogue at 0.84 {\AA}. Binding of the noncovalent ligand induces a proton transfer from the catalytic Ser70 to the negatively charged Glu166, and the formation of a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) between Ser70 and Lys73, with a length of 2.53 {\AA} and the shared hydrogen equidistant from the heteroatoms. QM/MM reaction path calculations determined the proton transfer barrier to be 1.53 kcal/mol. The LBHB is absent in the other two structures although Glu166 remains neutral in the covalent complex. Our data represents the first X-ray crystallographic example of a hydrogen engaged in an enzymatic LBHB, and demonstrates that desolvation of the active site by ligand binding can provide a protein microenvironment conducive to LBHB formation. It also suggests that LBHBs may contribute to stabilization of the TS in general acid/base catalysis together with other preorganized features of enzyme active sites. These structures reconcile previous experimental results suggesting alternatively Glu166 or Lys73 as the general base for acylation, and underline the importance of considering residue protonation state change when modeling protein?ligand interactions. Additionally, the observation of another LBHB (2.47 {\AA}) between two conserved residues, Asp233 and Asp246, suggests that LBHBs may potentially play a special structural role in proteins.},

The numerically stable iterative solution of conventional 3D-RISM equations includes the fragmental decomposition of flexible ligands, which are treated as distinct species in solvent mixtures of arbitrary complexity. The computed density functions for solution (including ligand) molecules are obtained as a set of discrete spatial grids that uniquely describe the continuous solvent-site distribution around the protein solute. Potentials of mean force derived from these distributions define the scoring function interfaced with the AutoDock program for an automated ranking of docked conformations. As a case study in terms of solvent composition, we analyze cooperative interactions encountered in the binding of a flexible thiamine molecule to the prion protein at near-physiological conditions. The predicted location and residency times of computed binding modes are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. {\copyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Based on a linear response theory, we identified protein motions coupled to the transient migration of ligand, carbon monoxide (CO), through channels. The result indicates that the coupled protein motions involve collective motions extended over the entire protein correlated with local gating motions at the channels. Protein motions, coupled to opening of a channel from the distal pocket to a neighboring xenon site, were found to share the collective motion with experimentally observed protein motions coupled to a doming motion of the heme Fe atom upon photodissociation of the ligand. Analysis based on generalized Langevin dynamics elucidated slow and diffusive features of the protein response motions. Remarkably small transmission coefficients for rates of the CO migrations through myoglobin were found, suggesting that the CO migration dynamics are characterized as motions governed by the protein dynamics involving the collective motions, rather than as thermally activated transitions across energy barriers of well-structured channels. {\copyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

The spectral lines are compared with quantum mechanical calculations for systems with two and three coordinates, with excellent agreement.

  abstract = {Cryptic pockets, i.e. sites on protein targets that only become apparent when drugs bind, provide a promising alternative to classical binding sites for drug development. Here we investigate the nature and dynamical properties of cryptic sites in four phar- macologically relevant targets, while comparing the efficacy of various simulation-based approaches in discovering them. We find that the studied cryptic sites do not corre- spond to local minima in the computed conformational free energy landscape of the un- liganded proteins. They thus promptly close in all the molecular dynamics simulations performed, irrespective of the force-field used. Temperature-based enhanced sampling approaches, such as Parallel Tempering, do not improve the situation, as the entropic term does not help in the opening of the sites. The use of fragment probes helps, as in long simulations occasionally it leads to the opening and binding to the cryptic sites. Our observed mechanism of cryptic site formation is suggestive of an interplay between two classical mechanisms: induced-fit and conformational selection. Employing this insight we developed a novel Hamiltonian Replica Exchange-based method ``SWISH'' (Sampling Water Interfaces through Scaled Hamiltonians), which combined with probes resulted in a promising general approach for cryptic site discovery. We also addressed the issue of ``false-positives'' and propose a simple approach to distinguish them from druggable cryptic pockets. Our simulations, whose cumulative sampling time was more than 200 {$\mu$}s , help clarifying the molecular mechanism of pocket formation, providing a solid basis for the choice of an efficient computational method.},

To date, experimental studies measuring conformational fluctuations of a whole protein structure have revealed that water molecules hydrating proteins are necessary to induce protein functional motions. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism behind such regulation remains unsolved. To clarify the mechanism, multi-domain proteins are good targets because it is obvious that water molecules between domains play an important role in domain motions. Here, we show how changes in hydration structure microscopically correlate with large-amplitude motions of a multi-domain protein, through molecular dynamics simulation supported by structural analyses and biochemical experiments. We first identified collective domain motions of the protein, which open/close an active-site cleft between domains. The analyses on changes in hydration structure revealed that changes in local hydration in the depth of the cleft are necessary for the domain motion and vice versa. In particular, 'wetting'/'drying' at a hydrophobic pocket and 'adsorption'/'dissociation' of a few water molecules at a hydrophilic crevice in the cleft were induced by dynamic rearrangements of hydrogen-bond networks, and worked as a switch for the domain motions. Our results microscopically demonstrated the importance of hydrogen-bond networks of water molecules in understanding energy landscapes of protein motions.}

  abstract = {Somatic mutations in the small GTPase K-Ras are the most common activating lesions found in human cancer, and are generally associated with poor response to standard therapies. Efforts to target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity, the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP and increases the proportion of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory site on Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner. {\copyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {The process of DNA replication is carried out with high efficiency and accuracy by DNA polymerases. The replicative polymerase in E. coli is DNA Pol III, which is a complex of 10 different subunits that coordinates simultaneous replication on the leading and lagging strands. The 1160-residue Pol III alpha subunit is responsible for the polymerase activity and copies DNA accurately, making one error per 105 nucleotide incorporations. The goal of this research is to determine the residues that contribute to the activity of the polymerase subunit. Homology modeling and the computational methods of THEMATICS and POOL were used to predict functionally important amino acid residues through their computed chemical properties. Site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical assays were used to validate these predictions. Primer extension, steady-state single-nucleotide incorporation kinetics, and thermal denaturation assays were performed to understand the contribution of these residues to the function of the polymerase. This work shows that the top 15 residues predicted by POOL, a set that includes the three previously known catalytic aspartate residues, seven remote residues, plus five previously unexplored first-layer residues, are important for function. Six previously unidentified residues, R362, D405, K553, Y686, E688, and H760, are each essential to Pol III activity; three additional residues, Y340, R390, and K758, play important roles in activity.}

  abstract = {The conformational dynamics of human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated by principal component analysis (PCA) applied to three molecular dynamics trajectories of 200 ns each. The overlap of the essential subspaces spanned by the first 10 principal components (PC) of different trajectories was about 0.3 showing that the PCA based on a trajectory length of 200 ns is not completely convergent for this protein. The contributions of the relative motion of subdomains and of the subdomains (internal) distortion to the first 10 PCs were found to be comparable. Based on the distribution of the first 3 PC, 10 protein conformers are identified showing relative root mean square deviations (RMSD) between 2.3 and 4.6 {\AA}. The main PCs are found to be delocalized over the whole protein structure indicating that the motions of different protein subdomains are coupled. This coupling is considered as being related to the allosteric effects observed upon ligand binding to HSA. On the other hand, the first PC of one of the three trajectories describes a conformational transition of the protein domain I that is close to that experimentally observed upon myristate binding. This is a theoretical support for the older hypothesis stating that changes of the protein onformation favorable to binding can precede the ligand complexation. A detailed all atoms PCA performed on the primary Sites 1 and 2 confirms the multiconformational character of the HSA binding sites as well as the significant coupling of their motions. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Typically, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these beta-lactamases. This extends the spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. The presence of ESBLs carries tremendous clinical significance. The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates. There is substantial debate as to the optimal method to prevent this occurrence. It has been proposed that cephalosporin breakpoints for the Enterobacteriaceae should be altered so that the need for ESBL detection would be obviated. At present, however, organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) provide guidelines for the detection of ESBLs in klebsiellae and Escherichia coli. In common to all ESBL detection methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against ESBL-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence of clavulanic acid. ESBLs represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic resistance mechanisms in the face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents.},

Now, CTX-M enzymes are being discovered throughout the world and are becoming the most prevalent beta-lactamases found in clinical isolates.

NMR relaxation methods can access these time scales if protein tumbling is prevented, but the isotropy required for high-resolution solution NMR is then lost. However, if the immobilized protein molecules are randomly oriented, the water 2H and 17O spins relax as in a solution of freely tumbling protein molecules, with the crucial difference that they now sample motions on all time scales up to approximately 100 micros. In particular, the exchange rates of internal water molecules can be determined directly from the 2H or 17O magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) profile. This possibility opens up a new window for characterizing the motions of individual internal water molecules as well as the large-scale protein conformational fluctuations that govern the exchange rates of structural water molecules. We introduce and validate this new NMR method by presenting and analyzing an extensive set of 2H and 17O MRD data from cross-linked gels of two model proteins: bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and ubiquitin. We determine residence times and order parameters of four internal water molecules in these proteins and show that they are quantitatively consistent with the information available from crystallography and solution MRD. We also show how slow motions of side-chains bearing labile hydrogens can be monitored by the same approach. Proteins of any size can be studied at physiological hydration levels with this method.},

  abstract = {Many proteins rely on rare structural fluctuations for their function, whereby solvent and other small molecules gain transient access to internal cavities. In magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments, water molecules buried in such cavities are used as intrinsic probes of the intermittent protein motions that govern their exchange with external solvent. While this has allowed a detailed characterization of exchange kinetics for several proteins, little is known about the exchange mechanism. Here, we use a millisecond all-atom MD trajectory produced by Shaw et al. (Science2010, 330, 341) to characterize water exchange from the four internal hydration sites in the protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Using a recently developed stochastic point process approach, we compute the survival correlation function probed by MRD experiments as well as other quantities designed to validate the exchange-mediated orientational randomization (EMOR) model used to interpret the MRD data. The EMOR model is found to be quantitatively accurate, and the simulation reproduces the experimental mean survival times for all four sites with activation energy discrepancies in the range 0-3 kBT. On the other hand, the simulated hydration sites are somewhat too flexible, and the water flip barrier is underestimated by up to 6 kBT. The simulation reveals that water molecules gain access to the internal sites by a transient aqueduct mechanism, migrating as single-file water chains through transient ({$<$}5 ns) tunnels or pores. The present study illustrates the power of state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations in validating and extending experimental results.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2018 Author(s). Much of biology happens at the protein-water interface, so all dynamical processes in this region are of fundamental importance. Local structural fluctuations in the hydration layer can be probed by17O magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD), which, at high frequencies, measures the integral of a biaxial rotational time correlation function (TCF) - the integral rotational correlation time. Numerous17O MRD studies have demonstrated that this correlation time, when averaged over the first hydration shell, is longer than in bulk water by a factor 3-5. This rotational perturbation factor (RPF) has been corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations, which can also reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we address several outstanding problems in this area by analyzing an extensive set of molecular dynamics data, including four globular proteins and three water models. The vexed issue of polarity versus topography as the primary determinant of hydration water dynamics is resolved by establishing a protein-invariant exponential dependence of the RPF on a simple confinement index. We conclude that the previously observed correlation of the RPF with surface polarity is a secondary effect of the correlation between polarity and confinement.

  abstract = {Much of biology happens at the protein-water interface, so all dynamical processes in this region are of fundamental importance. Local structural fluctuations in the hydration layer can be probed by 17O magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD), which, at high frequencies, measures the integral of a biaxial rotational time correlation function (TCF) - the integral rotational correlation time. Numerous 17O MRD studies have demonstrated that this correlation time, when averaged over the first hydration shell, is longer than in bulk water by a factor 3-5. This rotational perturbation factor (RPF) has been corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations, which can also reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we address several outstanding problems in this area by analyzing an extensive set of molecular dynamics data, including four globular proteins and three water models. The vexed issue of polarity versus topography as the primary determinant of hydration water dynamics is resolved by establishing a protein-invariant exponential dependence of the RPF on a simple confinement index. We conclude that the previously observed correlation of the RPF with surface polarity is a secondary effect of the correlation between polarity and confinement. Water rotation interpolates between a perturbed but bulk-like collective mechanism at low confinement and an exchange-mediated orientational randomization (EMOR) mechanism at high confinement.

Experiments performed on aqueous solution of a variety of biological systems of different nature, such as small hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, amino acids, dipeptides, and proteins, have shown that a significant increase in the dynamical retardation and in the extent of the perturbation of water surrounding solute molecules occurs at increasing chemical complexity of the solute. The behavior of aqueous solutions of lysozyme is here analyzed in detail, as a function of solute concentration. Our results provide evidence of a dynamical perturbation extending over more than three water layers in diluted solutions. We find a strong reduction in the average hydration number at increasing solute concentration that cannot be explained by the random superposition of hydration layers among lysozyme molecules in close proximity. This behavior is consistent with the formation of clusters in solution.},

  abstract = {Protein-protein interactions play an important role in all biological processes. However, the principles underlying these interactions are only beginning to be understood. Ubiquitin is a small signalling protein that is covalently attached to different proteins to mark them for degradation, regulate transport and other functions. As such, it interacts with and is recognised by a multitude of other proteins. We have conducted molecular dynamics simulations of ubiquitin in complex with 11 different binding partners on a microsecond timescale and compared them with ensembles of unbound ubiquitin to investigate the principles of their interaction and determine the influence of complex formation on the dynamic properties of this protein. Along the main mode of fluctuation of ubiquitin, binding in most cases reduces the conformational space available to ubiquitin to a subspace of that covered by unbound ubiquitin. This behaviour can be well explained using the model of conformational selection. For lower amplitude collective modes, a spectrum of zero to almost complete coverage of bound by unbound ensembles was observed. The significant differences between bound and unbound structures are exclusively situated at the binding interface. Overall, the findings correspond neither to a complete conformational selection nor induced fit scenario. Instead, we introduce a model of conformational restriction, extension and shift, which describes the full range of observed effects.}

  abstract = {Structure-function relationships in proteins are predicated on the spatial proximity of noncovalently interacting groups of atoms. Thus, structural elements located away from a protein's active site are typically presumed to serve a stabilizing or scaffolding role for the larger structure. Here we report a functional role for a distal structural element in a PDZ domain, even though it is not required to maintain PDZ structure. The third PDZ domain from PSD-95/SAP90 (PDZ3) has an unusual additional third alpha helix (alpha3) that packs in contiguous fashion against the globular domain. Although alpha3 lies outside the active site and does not make direct contact with C-terminal peptide ligand, removal of alpha3 reduces ligand affinity by 21-fold. Further investigation revealed that the difference in binding free energies between the full-length and truncated constructs is predominantly entropic in nature and that without alpha3, picosecond-nanosecond side-chain dynamics are enhanced throughout the domain, as determined by (2)H methyl NMR relaxation. Thus, the distal modulation of binding function appears to occur via a delocalized conformational entropy mechanism. Without removal of alpha3 and characterization of side-chain dynamics, this dynamic allostery would have gone unnoticed. Moreover, what appeared at first to be an artificial modification of PDZ3 has been corroborated by experimentally verified phosphorylation of alpha3, revealing a tangible biological mechanism for this novel regulatory scheme. This hidden dynamic allostery raises the possibility of as-yet unidentified or untapped allosteric regulation in this PDZ domain and is a very clear example of function arising from dynamics rather than from structure.},

Each protonated state, denoted as iH, where i = 0-4, has a different number of protonated histidines, from 0 to 4. The DF of water in each state exhibits closed structures of 0H, 1H, and 2H and open structures in 3H and 4H. In the closed form, the DF and PMF indicate that hydronium ions are excluded from the channel. In contrast, the ion can distribute throughout the opened channel. The barrier in PMF of 3H, {$\sim$}3-5 kJ/mol, is lower than that of 4H, 5-7 kJ/mol, indicating that 3H has higher permeability to protons. On the basis of the radial DFs of water and hydronium ions around the imidazole rings of His37, we propose a new mechanism of proton transfer through the gating region of the channel. In this process, a hydronium ion hands a proton to a non-protonated histidine through a hydrogen bond between them, and then the other protonated histidine releases a proton to a water molecule via a hydrogen bond. The process transfers a proton effectively from one water molecule to another. {\copyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.}

High-affinity SH3 ligands could compete for these interactions and specifically activate the Abl kinase, providing control and a better understanding of the molecular interactions that underlie diseases where SH3 domains are involved. The p41 peptide (APSYSPPPPP) is a member of a group of peptide ligands designed to bind specifically the Abl-SH3 domain. It binds to Abl-SH3 with a K(d) of 1.5 {$\mu$}M, whereas its affinity for the Fyn-SH3 domain is 273 {$\mu$}M. We have determined the crystal structure of the Abl-SH3 domain in complex with the high-affinity peptide ligand p41 at 1.6 {\AA} resolution. In the crystal structure, this peptide adopts a polyproline type II helix conformation through residue 5 to 10, and it binds in type I orientation to the Abl-SH3 domain. The tyrosine side-chain in position 4 of the peptide is hydrogen bonded to two residues in the RT-loop of the Abl-SH3 domain. The tight fit of this side-chain into the RT-loop pocket is enhanced by conformational adjustment of the main chain at position 5. The SH3 ligand peptides can be divided into two distinct parts. The N-terminal part binds to the SH3 domain in the region formed by the valley between the nSrc and RT-loops. It determines the specificity for different SH3 domains. The C-terminal part adopts a polyproline type II helix conformation. This binds to a well-conserved hydrophobic surface of the SH3 domain. Analysis of two 'half'-peptides, corresponding to these ligand parts, shows that both are essential components for strong binding to the SH3 domains. The crystal structure of the Abl-SH3:p41 complex explains the high affinity and specificity of the p41 peptide towards the Abl-SH3 domain, and reveals principles that will be exploited for future design of small, high-affinity ligands to interfere efficiently with the in vivo regulation of Abl kinase activity.},

Binding of the first cAMP to one subunit of a CAP dimer has no effect on the conformation of the other subunit. The dynamics of the system, however, are modulated in a distinct way by the sequential ligand binding process, with the first cAMP partially enhancing and the second cAMP completely quenching protein motions. As a result, the second cAMP binding incurs a pronounced conformational entropic penalty that is entirely responsible for the observed cooperativity. The results provide strong support for the existence of purely dynamics-driven allostery.},

  abstract = {Proteins are dynamic molecules that undergo conformational changes to a broad spectrum of different excited states. Unfortunately, the small populations of these states make it difficult to determine their structures or functional implications. Computer simulations are an increasingly powerful means to identify and characterize functionally relevant excited states. However, this advance has uncovered a further challenge: it can be extremely difficult to identify the most salient features of large simulation data sets. We reasoned that many functionally relevant conformational changes are likely to involve large, cooperative changes to the surfaces that are available to interact with potential binding partners. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a method that returns a prioritized list of potentially functional conformational changes by segmenting protein structures into clusters of residues that undergo cooperative changes in their solvent exposure, along with the hierarchy of interactions between these groups. We term these groups exposons to distinguish them from other types of clusters that arise in this analysis and others. We demonstrate, using three different model systems, that this method identifies experimentally validated and functionally relevant conformational changes, including conformational switches, allosteric coupling, and cryptic pockets. Our results suggest that key functional sites are hubs in the network of exposons. As a further test of the predictive power of this approach, we apply it to discover cryptic allosteric sites in two different {$\beta$}-lactamase enzymes that are widespread sources of antibiotic resistance. Experimental tests confirm our predictions for both systems. Importantly, we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, for a cryptic allosteric site in CTX-M-9 {$\beta$}-lactamase. Experimentally testing this prediction did not require any mutations and revealed that this site exerts the most potent allosteric control over activity of any pockets found in {$\beta$}-lactamases to date. Discovery of a similar pocket that was previously overlooked in the well-studied TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase demonstrates the utility of exposons.}

It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD.

Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it.

  abstract = {Background: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two subtypes of the virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2, have been characterized. The protease enzymes from these two subtypes, which are aspartic acid proteases and have been found to be essential for maturation of the infectious particle, share about 50\% sequence identity. Differences in substrate and inhibitor binding between these enzymes have been previously reported. Results We report the X-ray crystal structures of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases each in complex with the pseudosymmetric inhibitor, CGP 53820, to 2.2 {\aa} and 2.3 {\aa}, respectively. In both structures, the entire enzyme and inhibitor could be located. The structures confirmed earlier modeling studies. Differences between the CGP 53820 inhibitory binding constants for the two enzymes could be correlated with structural differences. Conclusion Minor sequence changes in subsites at the active site can explain some of the observed differences in substrate and inhibitor binding between the two enzymes. The information gained from this investigation may help in the design of equipotent HIV-1/HIV-2 protease inhibitors. {\copyright} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Transfer entropy is a recently introduced information-theoretic measure quantifying directed statistical coherence between spatiotemporal processes, and is widely used in diverse fields ranging from finance to neuroscience. However, its relationships to fundamental limits of computation, such as Landauer's limit, remain unknown. Here we show that in order to increase transfer entropy (predictability) by one bit, heat flow must match or exceed Landauer's limit. Importantly, we generalise Landauer's limit to bi-directional information dynamics for non-equilibrium processes, revealing that the limit applies to prediction, in addition to retrodiction (information erasure). Furthermore, the results are related to negentropy, and to Bremermann's limit and the Bekenstein bound, producing, perhaps surprisingly, lower bounds on the computational deceleration and information loss incurred during an increase in predictability about the process. The identified relationships set new computational limits in terms of fundamental physical quantities, and establish transfer entropy as a central measure connecting information theory, thermodynamics and theory of computation.}

However, these metrics do not provide any information on the causality relationships between residues. Such drive-response relationships are poorly studied in protein folding/function and difficult to measure experimentally due to technical limitations. In this study, using the information theory transfer entropy (TE) that provides a direct measurement of causality between two times series, we have quantified the drive-response relationships between residues in the folding/unfolding processes of four small proteins generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Instead of using a time-averaged single TE value, the time-dependent TE is measured with the Q-scores based on residue-residue contacts and with the statistical significance analysis along the folding/unfolding processes. The TE analysis is able to identify the driving and responding residues that are different from the highly correlated residues revealed by the mutual information analysis. In general, the driving residues have more regular secondary structures, are more buried, and show greater effects on the protein stability as well as folding and unfolding rates. In addition, the dominant driving and responding residues from the TE analysis on the whole trajectory agree with those on a single folding event, demonstrating that the drive-response relationships are preserved in the nonequilibrium process. Our study provides detailed insights into the protein folding process and has potential applications in protein engineering and interpretation of time-dependent residue-based experimental observables for protein function. {\copyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.}

We show our systematic construction procedure and careful analyses of the possible missing percentage of an initial ultrafast component with the established zero-time emission spectrum and limited temporal resolution through two methods of the direct mapping of femtosecond-resolved fluorescence spectra (3D FRES) and the constructed FRES (2D) from the fluorescence transients. We unambiguously validate our extended model with reexamination of solvation dynamics (methanol, water, and proteins) using conventional dye coumarin, intrinsic tryptophan, and cofactor flavin. Using mutant proteins of GB1, we show again the generality of the powerful probe tryptophan for protein hydration (solvation) and the slowdown of the hydration layer dynamics especially at the water-protein interface. These results justify the necessity of our extended solvation model, clarify the confusion of protein hydration in the recent literature, and establish the universal optical probe of tryptophan for heterogeneous protein dynamics.},

We observed the heterogeneous hydration dynamics around the global protein surface with two types of coupled motions, collective water/side-chain reorientation in a few picoseconds and cooperative water/side-chain restructuring in tens of picoseconds. The ultrafast dynamics in hundreds of femtoseconds is from the outer-layer, bulk-type mobile water molecules in the hydration shell. We also found that the hydration water dynamics are always faster than protein side-chain relaxations but with the same energy barriers, indicating hydration shell fluctuations driving protein side-chain motions on the picosecond time scales and thus elucidating their ultimate relationship.},

  abstract = {Employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study the formation of novel protein cryptic sites has attracted increasing interest in the field of drug discovery. One specific challenge in this area is finding a viable method to accurately identify and characterize cryptic site transitions from MD simulation results while minimizing the need for extensive human input. Since the formation of cryptic sites often involves significant conformational changes in the protein structure, a method capable of capturing and describing these dynamic pocket transitions with precision is essential. In this paper, we present a new procedure, Conformational Dynamics Capturing and Water-Based Characterization (CDC-WBC). This procedure dynamically identifies the cryptic site region by tracking protein conformational changes observed during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The procedure also incorporates water density information to enhance the characterization of cryptic sites across frames. We evaluate the CDC-WBC procedure by applying it to characterize the opening process of the two well-studied cryptic sites in TEM1 {$\beta$}-lactamase. The results demonstrate that the CDC-WBC method accurately captures the open-closed transitions of the two cryptic sites. For comparison, three commonly used protein cavity detection methods in cryptic sites studies, POVME2, Epock, and MDpocket, are applied to identify the ``CBT'' cryptic site in TEM1 {$\beta$}-lactamase. The results show that the CDC-WBC method outperforms these methods in characterizing the transitions of the ``CBT'' cryptic site. Additionally, using a benchmark set of 84 protein systems (93 cryptic pockets) from the CryptoSite data set, CDC-WBC consistently shows better performance in distinguishing between the open and closed states of cryptic sites, further highlighting its capability for precise characterization of dynamic cryptic site transitions.

  abstract = {The applicability of a computational method, Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS), to identify regions on a protein surface with which different types of functional groups on low-molecular weight inhibitors interact is demonstrated. The method involves molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a protein in an aqueous solution of chemically diverse small molecules from which probability distributions of fragments types, termed FragMaps, are obtained. In the present application, SILCS simulations are performed with an aqueous solution of 1 M benzene and propane to map the affinity pattern of the protein for aromatic and aliphatic functional groups. In addition, water hydrogen and oxygen atoms serve as probes for hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor affinity, respectively. The method is tested using a set of 7 proteins for which crystal structures of complexes with several high affinity inhibitors are known. Good agreement is obtained between FragMaps and the positions of chemically similar functional groups in inhibitors as observed in the X-ray crystallographic structures. Quantitative capabilities of the SILCS approach are demonstrated by converting FragMaps to free energies, termed Grid Free Energies (GFE), and showing correlation between the GFE values and experimental binding affinities. For proteins for which ligand decoy sets are available, GFE values are shown to typically score the crystal conformation and conformations similar to it more favorable than decoys. Additionally, SILCS is tested for its ability to capture the subtle differences in ligand affinity across homologous proteins, information which may be of utility toward specificity-guided drug design. Taken together, our results show that SILCS can recapitulate the known location of functional groups of bound inhibitors for a number of proteins, suggesting that the method may be of utility for rational drug design. {\copyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical properties of the docked molecules with efficient methods for sampling the conformational space of the ligand. If the ligand is flexible, it can adopt a large variety of different conformations. Each such minimum in conformational space presents a potential candidate for the conformation of the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking method samples the conformation space of the ligand on the basis of a discrete model and uses a tree-search technique for placing the ligand incrementally into the active site. For placing the first fragment of the ligand into the protein, we use hashing techniques adapted from computer vision. The incremental construction algorithm is based on a greedy strategy combined with efficient methods for overlap detection and for the search of new interactions. We present results on 19 complexes of which the binding geometry has been crystallographically determined. All considered ligands are docked in at most three minutes on a current workstation. The experimentally observed binding mode of the ligand is reproduced with 0.5 to 1.2 {\AA} rms deviation. It is almost always found among the highest-ranking conformations computed.},

It exists in mainly two bound forms at the active site of the concerned enzyme: the internal aldimine, in which the PLP is bound with the {$\epsilon$}-amino group of lysine at the active site, and the external aldimine, where the PLP is bound to the substrate amino acid. Both the internal and external aldimines have Schiff base linkage (N--H--O) and can exist in two tautomeric structures of ketoenamine and enolimine forms. In this work, we have investigated the free energy landscape for the tautomeric proton transfer in the internal and external aldimines at the active site of the ornithine decarboxylase enzyme in an aqueous medium. We performed hybrid quantum-classical metadynamics and force field-based molecular dynamics simulations, which revealed that the ketoenamine tautomer is more stable than the enolimine form. The QM/MM metadynamics calculations show that the free energy difference between the ketoenamine and enolimine forms for the internal aldimine is 3.9 kcal/mol, and it is found to be 5.8 kcal/mol for the external aldimine, with the ketoenamine form being more stable in both cases. The results are further supported by calculations of the binding free energies from classical simulations and static quantum chemical calculations in different environments. We have also analyzed the configurational structure of the microenvironment at the active site in order to have better insights into the interactions of the active site residues with the PLP in its two tautomeric forms.},

Among them, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has been extremely successful in the last decade and has become an indispensable technique for addressing many of the fundamental questions regarding the activities of IDPs. After introducing some experimental issues specific to IDPs and in relation to the latest technical developments, this article presents the interest of the theory of polymer physics to evaluate the flexibility of fully disordered proteins. The different strategies to obtain 3-dimensional models of IDPs, free in solution and associated in a complex, are then reviewed. Indeed, recent computational advances have made it possible to readily extract maximum information from the scattering curve with a special emphasis on highly flexible systems, such as multidomain proteins and IDPs. Furthermore, integrated computational approaches now enable the generation of ensembles of conformers to translate the unique flexible characteristics of IDPs by taking into consideration the constraints of more and more various complementary experiment. In particular, a combination of SAXS with high-resolution techniques, such as x-ray crystallography and NMR, allows us to provide reliable models and to gain unique structural insights about the protein over multiple structural scales. The latest neutron scattering experiments also promise new advances in the study of the conformational changes of macromolecules involving more complex systems.},

With respect to the microscopic details involved in the structural relaxation, these materials have remained an unsolved puzzle for over a century. The observation of spatial heterogeneity regarding the dynamics provides an important step towards understanding the relation between the macroscopic properties of soft condensed matter and the molecular mechanisms involved. On the other hand, dynamic heterogeneity is the source of several new questions: What is the length scale and persistence time associated with such clusters of relaxation time? What is the signature of heterogeneity at high temperatures and in the glassy state? How do these features depend on the particular material and on the correlation function used for probing these heterogeneities? This work attempts to review the various approaches to heterogeneous dynamics and the generally accepted results, as well as some controversial issues. Undoubtedly, heterogeneity has provoked a number of novel experimental techniques targeted at studying glass-forming liquids at the molecular level. It will be emphasized that the picture of heterogeneity is a requirement for rationalizing an increasing number of experimental observations rather than just an alternative model for the dynamics of molecules.}

  abstract = {Collective protein structural transitions couple with fluctuations of their aqueous environment to enable biological function. Although decades of experiment have investigated protein-motion hydration couplings, atomistic details regarding global hydration structures and their transitions associated with large-scale protein motions have remained elusive. This knowledge gap has hindered computer aided drug design strategies which fail to account for protein and aqueous structural transitions in a physically rigorous manor. Consequently, the detection of hidden drug binding sites hypothesized to form during rare conformational transitions has proven to be exceedingly difficult. These elusive pockets are named cryptic sites, and are of immense therapeutic value due to their ability to couple to enzymatic active sites and allosterically modulate catalytic activity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide excellent spatial and temporal resolution to observe protein and hydration dynamics but struggle to adequately sample cryptic site formations. Over the past decade the Yang lab has worked to overcome this deficiency by developing the Orthogonal Space Tempering (OST) enhanced sampling technique, uniquely designed to accelerate rare conformational transitions of biomolecules and their environment. The focus of this dissertation is to enrich computational drug development by understanding how collective protein motions are coupled to the aqueous environment. Towards this goal, a novel toolkit of GPU-accelerated algorithms has been developed to 1) elucidate the hydration structure enveloping proteins, 2) reveal collective protein and water structural fluctuations, and 3) map causal dynamics throughout proteins and their environment. These algorithms are first utilized on the millisecond long MD simulation of Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) performed by D. E. Shaw Research, one of the longest MD simulations performed to date. BPTI has been thoroughly investigated by biophysicists for decades and is known to harbor several buried water molecules, making it a fertile system to investigate hydration couplings. By application of our toolkit, we successfully characterize known conformational transitions of BPTI and elucidate how these motions are coupled to, and to an extent caused by, the aqueous environment. Next, OST is utilized to simulate TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase, an enzyme that harbors a pair of cryptic sites capable of modulating the degradation of {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics, making it a valuable therapeutic target in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Application of our toolkit characterizes large scale motions of TEM-1 and its aqueous environment, including expansions of the cryptic site cavities and the active site, which are connected to each other by structural hydration linkages. We then reveal immense couplings between TEM-1 and aqueous conformational transitions and investigate causal dynamics among the cryptic sites, active site, and the environment. Through the culmination of these analysis, we identify a prospective cryptic site that is allosterically linked to the active site by collective hydration fluctuations. In summary, the work presented here provides a promising foundation to enrich computational drug development strategies by understanding the intimate relationship between proteins and the aqueous environment.},

Ubiquitin, a small single-domain protein, displays rich dynamic properties over a wide range of time scales. In particular, several regions of ubiquitin show the signature of chemical exchange, including the hydrophobic patch and the {$\beta$}4-{$\alpha$}2 loop, which are both involved in many interactions. Here, we use multiple-quantum relaxation techniques to identify the extent of chemical exchange in ubiquitin. We employ our recently developed heteronuclear double resonance method to determine the time scales of motions that give rise to chemical exchange. Dispersion profiles are obtained for the backbone NH(N) pairs of several residues in the hydrophobic patch and the {$\beta$}4-{$\alpha$}2 loop, as well as the C-terminus of helix {$\alpha$}1. We show that a single time scale (ca. 50 {$\mu$}s) can be used to fit the data for most residues. Potential mechanisms for the propagation of motions and the possible extent of correlation of these motions are discussed.}

We attempt to recognize the change in complex water counteraction generated due to substantial alteration in flexibility during protein complex formation. The investigation is carried out with the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of receptors, expressed by an array of immune cells, and interacting with SLAM-associated protein (SAP), composed of one SH2 domain. All atom molecular dynamics simulations are employed to the aqueous solutions of free SAP and SLAM-peptide bound SAP. We observed that water dynamics around different secondary structural elements became highly affected as well as nicely correlated with the SLAM-peptide induced change in structural rigidity obtained by thermodynamic quantification. A few instances of contradictory dynamic features of water to the change in structural flexibility are explained by means of occluded polar residues by the peptide. For {$\beta$}D, EFloop, and BGloop, both structural flexibility and solvent accessibility of the residues confirm the obvious contribution. Most importantly, we have quantified enhanced restriction in water dynamics around the second Fyn-binding site of the SAP due to SAP-SLAM complexation, even prior to the presence of Fyn. This observation leads to a novel argument that SLAM induced more restricted water molecules could offer more water entropic contribution during the subsequent Fyn binding and provide enhanced stability to the SAP-Fyn complex in the signaling cascade. Finally, SLAM induced water counteraction around the second binding site of the SAP sheds light on the allosteric property of the SAP, which becomes an integral part of the underlying signal transduction mechanism.},

After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of {$\alpha$}-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of "Amber" force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone {$\varphi$}/{$\psi$} dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the {$\varphi$}/{$\psi$} dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote ff99SB, achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to PDB survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental NMR relaxation data of test protein systems. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Performing flexible structure-based virtual screening computations on thousands of targets with millions of molecules is intractable to most laboratories nor indeed desirable. Since shape complementarity is of primary importance for most protein-ligand interactions, we have developed a tool/protocol based on rigid-body docking to select compounds that fit well into binding sites. Results: Here we present an efficient multiple conformation rigid-body docking approach, MS-DOCK, which is based on the program DOCK. This approach can be used as the first step of a multi-stage docking/scoring protocol. First, we developed and validated the Multiconf-DOCK tool that generates several conformers per input ligand. Then, each generated conformer (bioactives and 37970 decoys) was docked rigidly using DOCK6 with our optimized protocol into seven different receptor-binding sites. MS-DOCK was able to significantly reduce the size of the initial input library for all seven targets, thereby facilitating subsequent more CPU demanding flexible docking procedures. Conclusion: MS-DOCK can be easily used for the generation of multi-conformer libraries and for shape-based filtering within a multi-step structure-based screening protocol in order to shorten computation times. {\copyright} 2008 Sauton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

The high quality of the spectra allowed us to measure the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), the transverse relaxation rate (R2), and the \{1H\}-15N NOE for up to 227 of the 250 potentially observable backbone amide groups. The model-free formalism was used to determine internal motional parameters using an axially anisotropic model. TEM-1 exhibits a small prolate axial anisotropy (D(parallel)/D(perpendicular) = 1.23 +/- 0.01) and a global correlation time (tau(m)) of 12.41 +/- 0.01 ns. The unusually high average generalized order parameter (S2) of 0.90 +/- 0.02 indicates that TEM-1 is one of the most ordered proteins studied by liquid-state NMR to date. Although the omega-loop has a high degree of order in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale (mean S2 value of 0.90 +/- 0.02), we observed the presence of microsecond-to-millisecond time scale motions for this loop, as for the vicinity of the active site. These motions could be relevant for the catalytic function of TEM-1. Amide exchange experiments were also performed, and several amide groups were not exchanged after 12 days, an indication that global motions in TEM-1 are also very limited. Although detailed dynamics characterization by NMR cannot be readily applied to TEM-1 in the presence of relevant substrates, the unusual picosecond-to-nanosecond dynamics behavior of TEM-1 presented here will be essential to the validation and improvement of future molecular dynamics simulations of TEM-1 in the presence of functionally relevant substrates.},

The coupling between water and protein dynamics has been intensively studied, yet it remains controversial. Here we combine protein perdeuteration, neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the nature of hydration water motions at temperatures between 200 and 300K, across the so-called protein dynamical transition, in the intrinsically disordered human protein tau and the globular maltose binding protein. Quasi-elastic broadening is fitted with a model of translating, rotating and immobile water molecules. In both experiment and simulation, the translationa component markedly increases at the protein dynamical transition (around 240K), regardless of whether the protein is intrinsically disordered or folded. Thus, we generalize the notion that the translational diffusion of water molecules on a protein surface promotes the large-amplitude motions of proteins that are required for their biological activity.}

Targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) is a method to induce a conformational change to a known target structure at ordinary temperature by applying a time-dependent, purely geometrical constraint. The transition is enforced independently of the height of energy barriers, while the dynamics of the molecule is only minimally influenced by the constraint. Simulations of decaalanine and insulin show the ability of the method to explore the configurational space for pathways accessible at a given temperature. The transitions studied at insulin comprise unfolding of an {$\alpha$}-helical portion and, in the reverse direction, refolding from an extended conformation. A possible application of TMD is the search for energy barriers and stable intermediates from rather local changes up to protein denaturation. {\copyright} 1994.},

Cryptic sites are atypical binding sites in proteins that are closed in the absence of a stabilizing ligand and are thus inherently difficult to identify. Many studies have proposed methods to predict cryptic sites. However, a general approach to prospectively sample open conformations of these sites and to identify cryptic pockets in an unbiased manner suitable for structure-based drug design remains elusive. Here, we describe an all-atom, explicit cosolvent, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-based workflow to sample the open states of cryptic sites and identify opened pockets, in a manner that does not require a priori knowledge about these sites. Furthermore, the workflow relies on a target-independent parameterization that only distinguishes between binding pockets for peptides or small-molecules. We validated our approach on a diverse test set of seven proteins with crystallographically determined cryptic sites. The known cryptic sites were found among the three highest-ranked predicted cryptic sites, and an open site conformation was sampled and selected for most of the systems. Crystallographic ligand poses were well reproduced by docking into these identified open conformations for five of the systems. When the fully open state could not be reproduced, we were still able to predict the location of the cryptic site, or identify other cryptic sites that could be retrospectively validated with knowledge of the protein target. These characteristics render our approach valuable for investigating novel protein targets without any prior information.}

Combined experimental and computational chemistry approaches take advantage of transition-state analogs to reveal dynamic motions linked to transition-state formation. QM/MM transition path sampling from reactive complexes provides both temporal and dynamic information for barrier crossing. Fast (femtosecond to picosecond) dynamic motions provide essential links to enzymatic barrier crossing by local or promoting-mode dynamic searches through bond-vibrational space. Transition-state lifetimes are within the femtosecond timescales of bond vibrations and show no manifestations of stabilized, equilibrated complexes. The slow binding and protein conformational changes (microsecond to millisecond) also required for catalysis are temporally decoupled from the fast dynamic motions forming the transition state. According to this view of enzymatic catalysis, transition states are formed by fast, coincident dynamic excursions of catalytic site elements, while the binding of transition-state analogs is the conversion of the dynamic excursions to equilibrated states.},

We hypothesize that the missing link is dynamics, information about the motions of the system. However, many of the techniques that give the best information about dynamics, such as solution nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations, cannot be easily applied to a protein as large as RT. As an alternative, we combine elastic network modeling with simultaneous hierarchical clustering of structural and dynamic data. We present an extensive survey of the dynamics of RT bound to a variety of ligands and with a number of mutations, revealing a novel mechanism for drug resistance to non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.

  abstract = {We present a generalized version of the ITIM algorithm for the identification of interfacial molecules, which is able to treat arbitrarily shaped interfaces. The algorithm exploits the similarities between the concept of probe sphere used in ITIM and the circumsphere criterion used in the {$\alpha$}-shapes approach, and can be regarded either as a reference-frame independent version of the former, or as an extended version of the latter that includes the atomic excluded volume. The new algorithm is applied to compute the intrinsic orientational order parameters of water around a dodecylphosphocholine and a cholic acid micelle in aqueous environment, and to the identification of solvent-reachable sites in four model structures for soot. The additional algorithm introduced for the calculation of intrinsic density profiles in arbitrary geometries proved to be extremely useful also for planar interfaces, as it allows to solve the paradox of smeared intrinsic profiles far from the interface.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that, in some cases, has been linked with mutations to the antioxidant metalloenzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Although the mature form of this enzyme is highly stable and resistant to aggregation, the most immature form, lacking metal and a stabilizing intrasubunit disulfide bond, apoSOD1(2SH), is dynamic and hypothesized to be a major cause of toxicity in vivo. Previous solution NMR studies of wild-type apoSOD1(2SH) have shown that the ground state interconverts with a series of sparsely populated and transiently formed conformers, some of which have aberrant nonnative structures. Here, we study seven disease mutants of apoSOD1(2SH) and characterize their free energy landscapes as a first step in understanding the initial stages of disease progression and, more generally, to evaluate the plasticity of low-lying protein conformational states. The mutations lead to little change in the structures and dynamics of the ground states of the mutant proteins. By contrast, the numbers of low-lying excited states that are accessible to each of the disease mutants can vary significantly, with additional conformers accessed in some cases. Our study suggests that the diversity of these structures can provide alternate interaction motifs for different mutants, establishing additional pathways for new and often aberrant intra- and intermolecular contacts. Further, it emphasizes the potential importance of conformationally excited states in directing both folding and misfolding processes.},

Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on pure water and an aqueous solution of myoglobin to determine the spatial distribution of water molecules in each of them. Their solution X-ray scattering (SXS) profiles were numerically evaluated with obtained atomic-coordinate data. It is shown that two kinds of contributions from solvent water must be considered to predict the SXS profile of a solution accurately. One is the excluded solvent scattering originating in exclusion of water molecules from the space occupied by solutes. The other is the hydration effect resulting from formation of a specific distribution of water around solutes. Explicit consideration of only two molecular layers of water is practically enough to incorporate the hydration effect. Care should be given to using an approximation in which an averaged electron density distribution is assumed for the structure factor because it may predict profiles considerably deviating from the correct profile at large K. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Equilibrium simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple folding and unfolding events that consistently follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate simulations of the protein's constituent substructures shed light on possible determinants of this pathway. A 1-millisecond simulation of the folded protein BPTI reveals a small number of structurally distinct conformational states whose reversible interconversion is slower than local relaxations within those states by a factor of more than 1000.},

A novel side chain to the backbone hydrogen bond that regulates these motions has also been identified. Combining our NMR studies with the available X-ray data, we have unearthed the physical process underlying slow motions-the interconversion of a type I into a type II {$\beta$}-turn flip at residues Glu51 through Arg54. Interestingly, the dominant conformer of wild-type ubiquitin observed in solution near neutral pH is only represented by about 22\% of the crystal structures.

  abstract = {Water molecules around a protein exhibit slow dynamics with respect to that of pure bulk water. One important issue in protein hydration is the thickness of the hydration layer (i.e., the distance from the protein surface up to which the water dynamics is influenced by the protein). Estimation of thickness is crucial to understand better the properties of "biological water" and the role that it plays in guiding the protein's function. We have performed an atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of an aqueous solution of the protein villin headpiece subdomain or HP-36 to estimate the thickness of its hydration water. In particular, several dynamical properties of water around different segments (three a-helices) of the protein have been calculated by varying the thickness of the hydration layers. It is found that in general the influence of the helices on water properties extends beyond the first hydration layer. However, the heterogeneous nature of water among the first hydration layers of the three helices diminishes as the thickness is increased. It indicates that, for a small protein such as HP-36, the thickness of "biological water" is uniform for different segments of the protein. {\copyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.}

Through an experimental and computational analysis of the ground state dynamics in ubiquitin, we identify a collective global motion that is specifically linked to a conformational switch distant from the binding interface. This allosteric coupling is also present in crystal structures and is found to facilitate multispecificity, particularly binding to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family of deubiquitinases. The collectivemotion that enables this allosteric communication does not affect binding through localized changes but, instead, depends on expansion and contraction of the entire protein domain. The characterization of these collective motions represents a promising avenue for finding and manipulating allosteric networks.}

  abstract = {Protein dynamics play an important role in small molecule binding and can pose a significant challenge in the identification of potential binding sites. Cryptic binding sites have been defined as sites which require significant rearrangement of the protein structure to become physically accessible to a ligand. Mixed-solvent MD (MixMD) is a computational protocol which maps the surface of the protein using molecular dynamics (MD) of the unbound protein solvated in a 5\% box of probe molecules with explicit water. This method has successfully identified known active and allosteric sites which did not require reorganization. In this study, we apply the MixMD protocol to identify known cryptic sites of 12 proteins characterized by a wide range of conformational changes. Of these 12 proteins, three require reorganization of side chains, five require loop movements, and four require movement of more significant structures such as whole helices. In five cases, we find that standard MixMD simulations are able to map the cryptic binding sites with at least one probe type. In two cases (guanylate kinase and TIE-2), accelerated MD, which increases sampling of torsional angles, was necessary to achieve mapping of portions of the cryptic binding site missed by standard MixMD. For more complex systems where movement of a helix or domain is necessary, MixMD was unable to map the binding site even with accelerated dynamics, possibly due to the limited timescale (100 ns for individual simulations). In general, similar conformational dynamics are observed in water-only simulations and those with probe molecules. This could imply that the probes are not driving opening events but rather take advantage of mapping sites that spontaneously open as part of their inherent conformational behavior. Finally, we show that docking to an ensemble of conformations from the standard MixMD simulations performs better than docking the apo crystal structure in nine cases and even better than half of the bound crystal structures. Poorer performance was seen in docking to ensembles of conformations from the accelerated MixMD simulations.},

Major conformational shift observed in the third intracellular loop (ICL3) displayed a novel inactive state, featuring an inaccessible G-protein binding site blocked by ICL3 and an expanded orthosteric ligand-binding site. Residue-based mean-square fluctuation and stiffness calculations revealed significant mobility decrease in ICL3, which induced mobility increase in remaining loop regions. This indicates conformational entropy loss in one mobile region being compensated by residual intermolecular motions in other mobile regions. Moreover, extent of significantly correlated motions decreased and correlations once existed between transmembrane helices shifted towards regions with increased mobility. Conditional time-...}

Conventional molecular (cMD) simulation is also performed for comparison. The present study reveals the following important properties of the loop dynamics: (1) The transition of loop 3-4 from open to closed state is observed in 200 ns aMD simulation. (2) In the absence of biotin binding, the open-state streptavidin is more stable, which is consistent with experimental evidences. The free energy ({\^I} "G) difference is about 5 kcal/mol between two states. But with biotin binding, the closed state is more stable due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the loop 3-4 and biotin. (3) The closure of loop 3-4 is concerted to the stable binding of biotin to streptavidin. When the loop 3-4 is in its open-state, biotin moves out of the binding pocket, indicating that the interactions between the loop 3-4 and biotin are essential in trapping biotin in the binding pocket. (4) In the tetrameric streptavidin system, the conformational change of the loop 3-4 in each monomer is independent of each other. That is, there is no cooperative binding for biotin bound to the four subunits of the tetramer.},

Over the past decade, the crucial roles of water molecules in protein structure, function, and dynamics have also become increasingly appreciated. This Perspective explores water in the biological environment by adopting its point of view in such phenomena. The prevailing thermodynamic models of the past, where water was seen largely in terms of an entropic gain after its displacement by a ligand, are now known to be much too simplistic. We adopt a set of terminology that describes water molecules as being "hot" and "cold", which we have defined as being easy and difficult to displace, respectively. The basis of these designations, which involve both enthalpic and entropic water contributions, are explored in several classes of biomolecules and structural motifs. The hallmarks for characterizing water molecules are examined, and computational tools for evaluating water-centric thermodynamics are reviewed. This Perspective's summary features guidelines for exploiting water molecules in drug discovery.}

A global analysis of the rebinding of carbon monoxide (CO) to myoglobin (Mb), monitored in the Soret band at temperatures from 60 to 150 K, is performed using a Newton-Raphson optimization algorithm. The MEM approach describes the data much better than traditional least-squares analyses, reducing {$\chi$}2by an order of magnitude. The MEM resolves two barrier distributions suggestive of rebinding to different bound conformations of MbCO, the so-called A1and A3substates, whose activation barriers have been independently estimated from kinetics monitored in the infrared. The distribution corresponding to A3possesses higher activation entropies, also consistent with infrared measurements. Within an A substate, correlations of S and H are recovered qualitatively from simulated data but can be difficult to obtain from experimental data. When the rebinding measured at 60 K is excluded from the inversion, two peaks are no longer clearly resolved. Thus, data of very high quality are required to unambiguously determine the kinetic resolvability of subpopulations and the shape of the barrier distribution for a single A substate.},

With the size of available datasets steadily increasing, it has become feasible to consider other, more general, definitions as well. One alternative, based on information theory, is the mutual information, providing a general measure of dependencies between variables. While the use of mutual information in cluster analysis and visualization of large-scale gene expression data has been suggested previously, the earlier studies did not focus on comparing different algorithms to estimate the mutual information from finite data. Results: Here we describe and review several approaches to estimate the mutual information from finite datasets. Our findings show that the algorithms used so far may be quite substantially improved upon. In particular when dealing with small datasets, finite sample effects and other sources of potentially misleading results have to be taken into account. {\copyright} Oxford University Press 2002.},

  abstract = {Water plays a unique role in all living organisms. Not only is it nature's ubiquitous solvent, but it also actively takes part in many cellular processes. In particular, the structure and properties of interfacial water near biomolecules such as proteins are often related to the function of the respective molecule. It can therefore be highly instructive to study the local water density around solutes in cellular systems, particularly when solvent-mediated forces such as the hydrophobic effect are relevant. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations seem well suited to study these systems at the atomic level. However, due to sampling requirements, it is not clear that MD simulations are, indeed, the method of choice to obtain converged densities at a given level of precision. We here compare the calculation of local water densities with two different methods: MD simulations and the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). In particular, we investigate the convergence of the local water density to assess the required simulation times for different levels of resolution. Moreover, we provide a quantitative comparison of the densities calculated with MD and with 3D-RISM-KH and investigate the effect of the choice of the water model for both methods. Our results show that 3D-RISM-KH yields density distributions that are very similar to those from MD up to a 0.5 {\AA} resolution, but for significantly reduced computational cost. The combined use of MD and 3D-RISM-KH emerges as an auspicious perspective for efficient solvent sampling in dynamical systems.},

Kauzmann's hydrophobic interaction hypothesis, which considers hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar groups as the dominant factor, has been widely accepted for about sixty years and attracted many scientists. The hypothesis, however, has not been verified or disproved because it is difficult, both theoretically and experimentally, to quantify the solvent effects on the free energy change in protein folding. Here, we developed a computational method for extracting the dominant factor behind thermodynamic stability of proteins and applied it to a small, designed protein, chignolin. The resulting free energy profile quantitatively agreed with the molecular dynamics simulations. Decomposition of the free energy profile indicated that intramolecular interactions predominantly stabilized collapsed conformations, whereas solvent-induced interactions, including hydrophobic ones, destabilized them. These results obtained for chignolin were consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis and calorimetry experiments for globular proteins with hydrophobic interior cores.},

It was shown that only few of these proteins have binding pockets that never form without ligand binding. Sites that are cryptic in some structures but spontaneously form in others are also rare. In most proteins the forming of pockets is affected by mutations or ligand binding at locations far from the cryptic site. To further explore these mechanisms, we applied adiabatic biased molecular dynamics simulations to guide the proteins from their ligand-free structures to ligand-bound conformations, and studied the distribution of druggability scores of the pockets located at the cryptic sites.}

In this work, we have obtained the spatial distribution functions gOO(r,{\textohm}) and gOH(r,{\textohm}) for liquid water and have applied them to an analysis of the equilibrium structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of SPC/E water have been carried out at temperatures of -10,25, and 100{$^\circ$}C and the local liquid structure examined. It is found that the unfolded O{$\cdots$}O distribution demonstrates, in addition to peaks consistent with a continuous tetrahedral network pattern, a distinct maximum in the local atomic pair density at "interstitial" separations of about 3.5 {\AA}. This local maximum is lost in the spatially folded radial distribution function gOO(r) due to averaging over the entire angular space. By examining the peaks in gOO(r,{\textohm}) due to nearest neighbors, we have shown that the tetrahedral network coordination number in liquid SPC/E water equals 4.0 and does not depend on temperature. The average number of molecules in additional nontetrahedral coordination, which is found to vary with temperature, has also been extracted, enabling us to establish full average coordination numbers of 4.8-5.0 in the temperature range of -10-100{$^\circ$}C. In addition, we have determined and analyzed statistical distributions for the pair energies and H-bond angles for different water fractions as identified from gOO(r,{\textohm}) and gOH(r, {\textohm}). {\copyright} 1993 American Institute of Physics.}

Time series, correlation functions, and the time development of the mean square fluctuations are examined. A wide range of relaxation times is found for the displacement correlation functions (0.2-10 ps); the values of the relaxation times correlate with aspects of the structure and with the magnitude of the mean square displacements, as expected from the Langevin equation for an oscillator. It is shown that the atomic fluctuations which contribute to the temperature factor (thermal ellipsoid) can be separated into local oscillations superposed on motions with a more collective character. The former have a subpicosecond time scale; the latter, which can involve only a few neighboring atoms, a residue, or groups of many atoms in a given region of the protein, have time scales ranging from 1 to 10 ps or longer (t = 3-30 cm-I). By following the time development of the atomic fluctuations from 0.2 to 25 ps, it is shown that the high-frequency oscillations, which contribute about 40\% of the average root mean square fluctuations of main chain atoms, tend to be uniform over the structure. It is the longer time scale, more collective motions which introduce the variations in the fluctuation magnitudes that characterize different parts of the protein structure. These distributed modes are likely to be most sensitive to the external medium and to other environmental perturbations. Implications of these results for the function of proteins and analysis of anisotropic temperature factors are discussed.},

X-ray structure determinations show that all class A {$\beta$}-lactamases are similar, but, despite the numerous kinetic investigations, the reaction mechanism of these enzymes is still debated. We address the questions of what the molecular contexts during the acylation and deacylation steps are and how they contribute to the efficiency of these penicillinases. Results Electrostatic analysis of the 1.8 {\aa} resolution refined X-ray structure of the wild-type enzyme, and of its modelled Michaelis and acyl-enzyme complexes, showed that substrate binding induces an upward shift in the pKa of the unprotonated Lys73 by 6.4 pH units. The amine group of Lys73 can then abstract the Ser70 hydroxyl group proton and promote acylation. In the acyl-enzyme complex, the deacylating water is situated between the carboxylate group of Glu166, within the enzyme, and the ester-carbonyl carbon of the acyl-enzyme complex, in an electrostatic potential gradient amounting to 30 kTe-1 {\aa}-1. Other residues, not directly involved in catalysis, also contribute to the formation of this gradient. The deacylation rate is related to the magnitude of the gradient. The kinetic behaviour of site-directed mutants that affect the protonation state of residue 73 cannot be explained on the basis of the wild-type enzyme mechanism. Conclusion In the wild-type enzyme, the very high rates of acylation and deacylation of class A {$\beta$}-lactamases arise from an optimal chemical setup in which the acylation reaction seems triggered by substrate binding that changes the general base property of Lys73. In site-directed mutants where Lys73 is protonated, acylation may proceed through activation of a water molecule by Glu166, and Lys73 contributes as a proton shuffle partner in this pathway. {\copyright} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {We present results from an extensive molecular dynamics simulation study of water hydrating the protein Ribonuclease A, at a series of temperatures in cluster, crystal, and powder environments. The dynamics of protein hydration water appear to be very similar in crystal and powder environments at moderate to high hydration levels. Thus, we contend that experiments performed on powder samples are appropriate for discussing hydration water dynamics in native protein environments. Our analysis reveals that simulations performed on cluster models consisting of proteins surrounded by a finite water shell with free boundaries are not appropriate for the study of the solvent dynamics. Detailed comparison to available x-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron-scattering data shows that current generation force fields are capable of accurately reproducing the structural and dynamical observables. On the time scale of tens of picoseconds, at room temperature and high hydration, significant water translational diffusion and rotational motion occur. At low hydration, the water molecules are translationally confined but display appreciable rotational motion. Below the protein dynamical transition temperature, both translational and rotational motions of the water molecules are essentially arrested. Taken together, these results suggest that water translational motion is necessary for the structural relaxation that permits anharmonic and diffusive motions in proteins. Furthermore, it appears that the exchange of protein-water hydrogen bonds by water rotational/librational motion is not sufficient to permit protein structural relaxation. Rather, the complete exchange of protein-bound water molecules by translational displacement seems to be required.},

The proportion of residues whose main-chain atoms are in contact with water molecules was fairly constant (between 40\% and 60\%), irrespective of the nature of the side-chain. However, the proportion of residues whose side-chain atoms were in contact with water molecules showed a clear (inverse) correlation with the hydrophobicity of the residue, being as low as 14\% for leucine and isoleucine but greater than 80\% for asparagine and arginine. Despite the problems in determining accurate water molecule sites from X-ray diffraction data and the complexity of the protein surface, distinct non-random distributions of water molecules were found. These hydration patterns are consistent with the expected stereochemistry of the potential hydrogen-bonding sites on the polar side-chains. The water molecules around apolar side-chains lie predominantly at van der Waals' contact distances, but most of these have a primary, shorter contact with a neighbouring polar atom. Further analysis of these distributions, combined with energy minimization techniques, should lead to improved modelling of protein structures, including their primary shells of hydration. {\copyright} 1988.},

The affinity-optimized compound (IC50 = 0.06 {$\mu$}M), which has an added aromatic acid fragment, bound in the same groove as the lead compound. In addition, a novel binding site was formed for the aromatic acid which is unseen in the complex with the lead compound. Thus, the hot spot on IL-2 is highly dynamic, with the protein changing form at multiple sites to maximize packing for each compound. Binding-site rigidity is often thought to play a role in high-affinity interactions. However, in this case, specific contacts between the small molecule and the protein are made despite the adaptivity of the hot spot. Given the change in morphology that was observed in IL-2, it is unlikely that a potent inhibitor could have been found by rational design. Therefore, fragment assembly methods offer the stochastic advantage of finding fragments in flexible protein regions where structural changes are unpredictable.

To combat these enzymes, inhibitors covalently cross-linking the hydrolytic Ser70 to Ser130 were introduced. In turn, mutant beta-lactamases have emerged with decreased susceptibility to these mechanism-based inhibitors. Substituting Ser130 with glycine in the inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) mutant TEM-76 (S130G) prevents the irreversible cross-linking step. Since the completely conserved Ser130 is thought to transfer a proton important for catalysis, its substitution might be hypothesized to result in a nonfunctional enzyme; this is clearly not the case. To investigate how TEM-76 remains active, its structure was determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.40 A resolution. A new water molecule (Wat1023) is observed in the active site, with two configurations located 1.1 and 1.3 A from the missing Ser130 Ogamma; this water molecule likely replaces the Ser130 side-chain hydroxyl in substrate hydrolysis. Intriguingly, this same water molecule is seen in the IRT TEM-32 (M69I/M182T), where Ser130 has moved significantly. TEM-76 shares other structural similarities with various IRTs; like TEM-30 (R244S) and TEM-84 (N276D), the water molecule activating clavulanate for cross-linking (Wat1614) is disordered (in TEM-30 it is actually absent). As expected, TEM-76 has decreased kinetic activity, likely due to the replacement of the Ser130 side-chain hydroxyl with a water molecule. In contrast to the recently determined structure of the S130G mutant in the related SHV-1 beta-lactamase, in TEM-76 the key hydrolytic water (Wat1561) is still present. The conservation of similar accommodations among IRT mutants suggests that resistance arises from common mechanisms, despite the disparate locations of the various substitutions},

DXPS catalyzes the activation of pyruvate to give the C2{$\alpha$}-lactylThDP (LThDP) adduct that is long-lived on DXPS in a closed state in the absence of the cosubstrate.

How LThDP persists on DXPS in the absence of cosubstrate, while other pyruvate decarboxylases readily activate LThDP for decarboxylation, is a long-standing question in the field. We propose that an active site network functions to prevent LThDP activation on DXPS until the cosubstrate binds.

There is a pressing need for novel, non-{$\beta$}-lactam inhibitors of these enzymes. One previously discovered novel inhibitor of the {$\beta$}-lactamase AmpC, compound 1, has several favorable properties: it is chemically dissimilar to {$\beta$}-lactams and is a noncovalent, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. However, at 26 {$\mu$}M its activity is modest. Using the X-ray structure of the AmpC/1 complex as a template, 14 analogues were designed and synthesized. The most active of these, compound 10, had a K i  of 1 {$\mu$}M, 26-fold better than the lead. To understand the origins of this improved activity, the structures of AmpC in complex with compound 10 and an analogue, compound 11, were determined by X-ray crystallography to 1.97 and 1.96 {\AA}, respectively. Compound 10 was active in cell culture, reversing resistance to the third generation cephalosporin ceftazidime in bacterial pathogens expressing AmpC. In contrast to {$\beta$}-lactam-based inhibitors clavulanate and cefoxitin, compound 10 did not up-regulate {$\beta$}-lactamase expression in cell culture but simply inhibited the enzyme expressed by the resistant bacteria. Its escape from this resistance mechanism derives from its dissimilarity to {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics. {\copyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

The IR spectrum of neat liquid H2O and the TRIR anisotropy of a liquid mixture of H2O/HDO/D2O are also calculated. It is shown that the calculated features of these optical signals, including the temperature dependence of the polarized Raman and IR spectra, are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results, indicating that the frequency separation between the isotropic and anisotropic components of the polarized Raman spectrum and the rapid decay (approximately 0.1 ps) of the TRIR anisotropy of the OH stretching mode of neat liquid H2O are mainly controlled by the resonant intermolecular vibrational coupling described by the TDC mechanism. Comparing with the time evolution of vibrational excitations, it is suggested that the TRIR anisotropy decays in the time needed for the initially localized vibrational excitations to delocalize over a few oscillators. It is also shown that the enhancement of the dipole derivatives by the interactions with surrounding molecules is an important factor in generating the spectral profiles of the OH stretching Raman band.

Therapeutic targeting of the monomeric state of such intrinsically disordered proteins by small molecules has, however, been a major challenge because of their heterogeneous conformational properties. We show here that a combination of computational and experimental techniques has led to the identification of a drug-like phenyl-sulfonamide compound (ELN484228), that targets {$\alpha$}-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease. We found that this compound has substantial biological activity in cellular models of {$\alpha$}-synuclein-mediated dysfunction, including rescue of {$\alpha$}-synuclein- induced disruption of vesicle trafficking and dopaminergic neuronal loss and neurite retraction most likely by reducing the amount of {$\alpha$}-synuclein targeted to sites of vesicle mobilization such as the synapse in neurons or the site of bead engulfment in microglial cells.

A dual heatbath method is used with which, in any given simulation, the protein and solvent are held at different temperatures, and sets of simulations are performed varying the temperature of the components. The results show that the protein transition is driven by a dynamical transition in the hydration water that induces increased fluctuations primarily in side chains in the external regions of the protein.

  abstract = {The question of how allostery works was posed almost 50 years ago. Since then it has been the focus of much effort. This is for two reasons: first, the intellectual curiosity of basic science and the desire to understand fundamental phenomena, and second, its vast practical importance. Allostery is at play in all processes in the living cell, and increasingly in drug discovery. Many models have been successfully formulated, and are able to describe allostery even in the absence of a detailed structural mechanism. However, conceptual schemes designed to qualitatively explain allosteric mechanisms usually lack a quantitative mathematical model, and are unable to link its thermodynamic and structural foundations. This hampers insight into oncogenic mutations in cancer progression and biased agonists' actions. Here, we describe how allostery works from three different standpoints: thermodynamics, free energy landscape of population shift, and structure; all with exactly the same allosteric descriptors. This results in a unified view which not only clarifies the elusive allosteric mechanism but also provides structural grasp of agonist-mediated signaling pathways, and guides allosteric drug discovery. Of note, the unified view reasons that allosteric coupling (or communication) does not determine the allosteric efficacy; however, a communication channel is what makes potential binding sites allosteric.}

Probe-based/cosolvent molecular dynamics (MD) methods that allow for protein flexibility have been developed to predict ligand binding sites. However, cryptic pockets that appear only upon ligand binding and occluded binding sites with no access to the solvent pose significant challenges to these methods. Here, we report the development of accelerated ligand-mapping MD (aLMMD), which combines accelerated MD with LMMD, for the detection of these challenging binding sites. The method was validated on five proteins with what we term ``recalcitrant'' cryptic pockets, which are deeply buried pockets that require extensive movement of the protein backbone to expose, and three proteins with occluded binding sites. In all the cases, aLMMD was able to detect and sample the binding sites. Our results suggest that aLMMD could be used as a general approach for the detection of such elusive binding sites in protein targets, thus providing valuable information for SBDD.},

Allosteric proteins can exist in several conformational states with distinct binding or enzymatic activity. Effectors are considered to function in a purely structural manner by selectively stabilizing a specific conformational state, thereby regulating protein activity. Here we show that allosteric proteins can be regulated predominantly by changes in their structural dynamics. We have used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to characterize cyclic AMP (cAMP) binding to the catabolite activator protein (CAP), a transcriptional activator that has been a prototype for understanding effector-mediated allosteric control of protein activity7. cAMP switches CAP from the `off' state (inactive), which binds DNA weakly and non-specifically, to the `on' state (active), which binds DNA strongly and specifically. In contrast, cAMP binding to a single CAP mutant, CAP-S62F, fails to elicit the active conformation; yet, cAMP binding to CAP-S62F strongly activates the protein for DNA binding. NMR and thermodynamic analyses show that despite the fact that CAP-S62F-cAMP2 adopts the inactive conformation, its strong binding to DNA is driven by a large conformational entropy originating in enhanced protein motions induced by DNA binding. The results provide strong evidence that changes in protein motions may activate allosteric proteins that are otherwise structurally inactive.},

As standard structural approaches are typically concerned with changes in the ground-state structure of proteins, the presence of such a mechanism can go easily undetected. Our data strongly argue for the routine use of NMR tools suited to detect and characterize transiently formed conformational states in allosteric systems. Structure information on such important intermediates can ultimately result in more efficient design of allosteric inhibitors.},

We performed molecular dynamics simulations of a protein system and showed that the water molecules collectively move around the protein. The motions of two water molecules, which were about 12 {\AA} away from each other, are correlated to each other. Such collective motions of water can be regarded as flows around the protein, and the flows exhibited various coherent patterns: fair currents, vortices, and divergent flows. The patterns were highly fluctuating: a set of patterns changed to a different set of patterns within a time scale of 10 ps. Thus, the water motions observed in a scale of length smaller than 12 {\AA} and a time scale shorter than 10 ps were nondiffusive, and the motions above these scales were diffusive, where the flows disappeared. The flows near the protein surface had an orientational propensity to be highly parallel to the protein surface, and this propensity gradually vanished with an increment of distance from the protein surface. The divergent patterns of flows, which frequently emerge during the fluctuations of flows, may temporarily cause solvent drying in the vicinity of solutes. The current simulation is supportive of a molecular interaction mechanism that the fluctuations of hydration structure induce attractive interactions between solutes. {\copyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

The patterns can be regarded as "flows" of three specific patterns-fair current, drying/wetting, and vortex-although the patterns disappear eventually over a longer time scale. Our earlier study suggested a hypothesis that the solvent flows are related to the intersolute interaction. However, the connection between the flows and the interaction was left unexamined. The current simulation study analyzed flow patterns around a protein, human lysozyme, revealing that the drying flows correlate with decreased solvent density. The decrease in solvent density has been known to enhance intersolute attractive interactions. The drying flows can therefore induce the intersolute attractive interactions. Human lysozyme has a catalytic cleft on the protein surface. Large fluctuations of drying/wetting patterns were observed only around the cleft because the large fluctuations occur selectively around convex residues on the protein surface, to which large side-chain fluctuations of the protein are also assigned. The emergence of fair current patterns correlated well with the emergence of drying/wetting patterns. This correlation was found only near the protein surface. Near the protein surface, the vortex flow plane of rotation tended to be parallel to the surface. Current study suggests that the drying flows enhance the substrate approach to the catalytic cleft. {\copyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

In the absence of an exogenous ligand, the distal histidine (His64) binds to the heme iron in the ferrous and ferric states. The crystal structure of murine ferric (met) neuroglobin at 1.5 {\AA} reveals interesting features relevant to the ligand binding mechanism. Only weak selectivity is observed for the two possible heme orientations, the occupancy ratio being 70:30. Two small internal cavities are present on the heme distal side, which enable the His64(E7) side chain to move out of the way upon exogenous ligand binding. Moreover, a third, huge cavity (volume approximately 290 {\AA}3) connecting both sides of the heme, is open towards the exterior and provides a potential passageway for ligands. The CD and EF corners exhibit substantial flexibility, which may assist ligands in entering the protein and accessing the active site.

Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics.

  abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics is a computer simulation technique that is in widespread use across many areas of science, from physics and chemistry to materials, biology, and medicine. The method continues to attract criticism due its oft-reported lack of reproducibility which is in part due to a failure to submit it to reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). Here we show that the uncertainty arises from a combination of (i) the input parameters and (ii) the intrinsic stochasticity of the method controlled by the random seeds. To illustrate the situation, we make a systematic UQ analysis of a widely used molecular dynamics code (NAMD), applied to estimate binding free energy of a ligand-bound to a protein. In particular, we replace the usually fixed input parameters with random variables, systematically distributed about their mean values, and study the resulting distribution of the simulation output. We also perform a sensitivity analysis, which reveals that, out of a total of 175 parameters, just six dominate the variance in the code output. Furthermore, we show that binding energy calculations dampen the input uncertainty, in the sense that the variation around the mean output free energy is less than the variation around the mean of the assumed input distributions, if the output is ensemble-averaged over the random seeds. Without such ensemble averaging, the predicted free energy is five times more uncertain. The distribution of the predicted properties is thus strongly dependent upon the random seed. Owing to this substantial uncertainty, robust statistical measures of uncertainty in molecular dynamics simulation require the use of ensembles in all contexts.}

  abstract = {Over the last forty years many computer simulations of water have been performed using rigid non-polarizable models. Since these models describe water interactions in an approximate way it is evident that they cannot reproduce all of the properties of water. By now many properties for these kinds of models have been determined and it seems useful to compile some of these results and provide a critical view of the successes and failures. In this paper a test is proposed in which 17 properties of water, from the vapour and liquid to the solid phases, are taken into account to evaluate the performance of a water model. A certain number of points between zero (bad agreement) and ten (good agreement) are given for the predictions of each model and property. We applied the test to five rigid non-polarizable models, TIP3P, TIP5P, TIP4P, SPC/E and TIP4P/2005, obtaining an average score of 2.7, 3.7, 4.7, 5.1, and 7.2 respectively. Thus although no model reproduces all properties, some models perform better than others. It is clear that there are limitations for rigid non-polarizable models. Neglecting polarizability prevents an accurate description of virial coefficients, vapour pressures, critical pressure and dielectric constant. Neglecting nuclear quantum effects prevents an accurate description of the structure, the properties of water below 120 K and the heat capacity. It is likely that for rigid non-polarizable models it may not be possible to increase the score in the test proposed here beyond 7.6. To get closer to experiment, incorporating polarization and nuclear quantum effects is absolutely required even though a substantial increase in computer time should be expected. The test proposed here, being quantitative and selecting properties from all phases of water can be useful in the future to identify progress in the modelling of water.},

  abstract = {We present a new shape-based method, LigandFit, for accurately docking ligands into protein active sites. The method employs a cavity detection algorithm for detecting invaginations in the protein as candidate active site regions. A shape comparison filter is combined with a Monte Carlo conformational search for generating ligand poses consistent with the active site shape. Candidate poses are minimized in the context of the active site using a grid-based method for evaluating protein-ligand interaction energies. Errors arising from grid interpolation are dramatically reduced using a new non-linear interpolation scheme. Results are presented for 19 diverse protein-ligand complexes. The method appears quite promising, reproducing the X-ray structure ligand pose within an RMS of 2{\AA} in 14 out of the 19 complexes. A high-throughput screening study applied to the thymidine kinase receptor is also presented in which LigandFit, when combined with LigScore, an internally developed scoring function [1], yields very good hit rates for a ligand pool seeded with known actives. {\copyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

  abstract = {Structural coverage of the human kinome has been steadily increasing over time. The structures provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of kinase function and also provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of kinase inhibitors. There are a large number of kinase structures in the PDB for which the Asp and Phe of the DFG motif on the activation loop swap positions, resulting in the formation of a new allosteric pocket. We refer to these structures as "classical DFG-out" conformations in order to distinguish them from conformations that have also been referred to as DFG-out in the literature but that do not have a fully formed allosteric pocket. We have completed a structural analysis of almost 200 small molecule inhibitors bound to classical DFG-out conformations; we find that they are recognized by both type I and type II inhibitors. In contrast, we find that nonclassical DFG-out conformations strongly select against type II inhibitors because these structures have not formed a large enough allosteric pocket to accommodate this type of binding mode. In the course of this study we discovered that the number of structurally validated type II inhibitors that can be found in the PDB and that are also represented in publicly available biochemical profiling studies of kinase inhibitors is very small. We have obtained new profiling results for several additional structurally validated type II inhibitors identified through our conformational analysis. Although the available profiling data for type II inhibitors is still much smaller than for type I inhibitors, a comparison of the two data sets supports the conclusion that type II inhibitors are more selective than type I. We comment on the possible contribution of the DFG-in to DFG-out conformational reorganization to the selectivity.}

This is because it can inactivate most beta-lactam antibiotic drugs by hydrolyzing them. For in-depth understanding of the hydrolysis mechanism, the three-dimensional structure of NDM-1 was developed. With such a structural frame, two enzyme-ligand complexes were derived by respectively docking Imipenem and Meropenem (two typical beta-lactam antibiotic drugs) to the NDM-1 receptor. It was revealed from the NDM-1/Imipenem complex that the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed while sitting in a binding pocket of NDM-1 formed by nine residues. And for the case of NDM-1/Meropenem complex, the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed in a binding pocket formed by twelve residues. All these constituent residues of the two binding pockets were explicitly defined and graphically labeled. It is anticipated that the findings reported here may provide useful insights for developing new antibiotic drugs to overcome the resistance problem. {\copyright} 2011 Wang, Chou.}

Although vsREMD achieved results consistent with those from conventional REMD and experimental studies, the number of replicas required for vsREMD (30) was much less than that for conventional REMD (80) to achieve a similar acceptance rate (\$0.2), demonstrating high efficiency of vsREMD to characterize the protein conformational change and associated free-energy profile.

To meet the urgent requirement of new TB drugs with novel modes of action, the TB research community has been validating numerous targets from several biosynthetic pathways. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is utilized by Mtb for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the universal five-carbon building blocks of isoprenoids. While being a common biosynthetic pathway in pathogens, the MEP pathway is completely absent in humans. Due to its unique presence in pathogens as well as the essentiality of the MEP pathway in Mtb, the enzymes in this pathway are promising targets for the development of new drugs against tuberculosis. In this Review, we discuss three enzymes in the MEP pathway: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5phosphate reductoisomerase (IspC/DXR), and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), which appear to be the most promising antitubercular drug targets. Structural and mechanistic features of these enzymes are reviewed, as well as selected inhibitors that show promise as antitubercular agents.},

Based on these computational methods, a new generation of inhibitors derived from quinazoline and pyrimidine-based tricyclic scaffolds were synthesized and evaluated for Aurora A kinase inhibitory activity, which led to the identification of 4-(6,7-dimethoxy-9H-1, 3,9-triaza-fluoren-4-yl)-piperazine-1-carbothioic acid [4-(pyrimidin-2-ylsulfamoyl)-phenyl]-amide. The lead compound showed selectivity for the Aurora kinases when it was evaluated against a panel of diverse kinases. Additionally, the compound was evaluated in cell-based assays, showing a dose-dependent decrease in phospho-histone H3 levels and an arrest of the cell cycle in the G2-M fraction. Although biological effects were observed only at relatively high concentrations, this chemical series provides an excellent starting point for drug optimization and further development.

Transient structural fluctuations underlie a wide range of processes, including enzyme catalysis, ligand binding to buried sites, and generic protein motions, such as 180{$^\circ$} rotation of aromatic side chains in the protein interior, but remain poorly understood. Understanding the dynamics and molecular nature of concerted motions requires characterization of their rates and energy barriers. Here we use recently developed (13)C transverse relaxation dispersion methods to improve our current understanding of aromatic ring flips in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). We validate these methods by benchmarking ring-flip rates against the three previously characterized cases in BPTI, namely, Y23, Y35, and F45. Further, we measure conformational exchange for one additional aromatic ring, F22, which can be interpreted in terms of a flip rate of 666 s(-1) at 5 {$^\circ$}C. Upon inclusion of our previously reported result that Y21 also flips slowly [Weininger, U., et al. (2013) J. Phys. Chem. B 117, 9241-9247], the (13)C relaxation dispersion experiments thus reveal relatively slow ring-flip rates for five of eight aromatic residues in BPTI. These results are in contrast with previous reports, which have estimated that all rings, except Y23, Y35, and F45, flip with a high rate at ambient temperature. The (13)C relaxation dispersion data result in an updated rank order of ring-flip rates in BPTI, which agrees considerably better with that estimated from a recent 1 ms molecular dynamics trajectory than do previously published NMR data. However, significant quantitative differences remain between experiment and simulation, in that the latter yields flip rates that are in many cases too fast by 1-2 orders of magnitude. By measuring flip rates across a temperature range of 5-65 {$^\circ$}C, we determined the activation barriers of ring flips for Y23, Y35, and F45. Y23 and F45 have identical activation parameters, suggesting that the fluctuations of the protein core around these residues are similar in character. Y35 differs from the other two in its apparent activation entropy. These results might be rationalized by the fact that Y23 and F45 are located in the same region of the structure while Y35 is remote from the other two rings. As indicated by our new results for the exceptionally well-characterized protein BPTI, (13)C relaxation dispersion experiments open the possibility of studying ring flips in a range of cases wider than that previously possible.},

On this basis it was hypothesized that differences in membrane permeability to aldopentoses provide a mechanism for preferential delivery of ribose to primitive cells for subsequent selective incorporation into nucleotides and their polymers. However, the origins of these unusually large differences have not been well understood. We address this issue in molecular dynamics simulations combined with free energy calculations. It is found that the free energy of transferring ribose from water to the bilayer is lower by 1.5-2 kcal/mol than the barrier for transferring the other two aldopentoses. The calculated and measured permeability coefficients are in excellent agreement. The sugar structures that permeate the membrane are {$\beta$}-pyranoses, with a possible contribution of the R-anomer for arabinose. The furanoid form of ribose is not substantially involved in permeation, even though it is non-negligibly populated in aqueous solution. The differences in free energy of transfer between ribose and arabinose or xylose are attributed, at least in part, to stronger highly cooperative, intramolecular interactions between consecutive exocyclic hydroxyl groups, which are stable in nonpolar media but rare in water. Water/hexadecane partition coefficients of the sugars obtained from separate molecular dynamics simulations correlate with the calculated permeability coefficients, in qualitative agreement with the Overton rule. The relevance of our calculations to understanding the origins of life is discussed. {\copyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

Characterizing the active site's shape as well as the distribution of surrounding residues plays an important role for a variety of applications such as automated ligand docking or in situ modeling. Comparing the shape similarity of binding site geometries of related proteins provides further insights into the mechanisms of ligand binding. Results: We present PocketPicker, an automated grid-based technique for the prediction of protein binding pockets that specifies the shape of a potential binding-site with regard to its buriedness. The method was applied to a representative set of protein-ligand complexes and their corresponding opo-protein structures to evaluate the quality of binding-site predictions. The performance of the pocket detection routine was compared to results achieved with the existing methods CAST, LIGSITE, LIGSITE cs PASS and SURFNET. Success rates PocketPicker were comparable to those of LIGSITE cs and outperformed the other tools. We introduce a descriptor that translates the arrangement of grid points delineating a detected binding-site into a correlation vector. We show that this shape descriptor is suited for comparative analyses of similar binding-site geometry by examining induced-fit phenomena in aldose reductase. This new method uses information derived from calculations of the buriedness of potential binding-sites. Conclusion: The pocket prediction routine of PocketPicker is a useful tool for identification of potential protein binding-pockets. It produces a convenient representation of binding-site shapes including an intuitive description of their accessibility. The shape-descriptor for automated classification of binding-site geometries can be used as an additional tool complementing elaborate manual inspections.}

Here we describe the discovery of an allosteric site in PTP1B. Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with allosteric inhibitors reveal a novel site located approximately 20 A from the catalytic site. We show that allosteric inhibitors prevent formation of the active form of the enzyme by blocking mobility of the catalytic loop, thereby exploiting a general mechanism used by tyrosine phosphatases. Notably, these inhibitors exhibit selectivity for PTP1B and enhance insulin signaling in cells. Allosteric inhibition is a promising strategy for targeting PTP1B and constitutes a mechanism that may be applicable to other tyrosine phosphatases.},

The number of hydrogen bonds formed between each water molecule and the protein varies from 0 to 4, with 3 being most common. Nearly half of the water molecules are found in pairs or larger clusters. Approximately 90\% are shown to be associated with large cavities within the protein, as determined by a novel program, PRO\_ACT. The total volume of a protein's large cavities is proportional to its molecular weight and is not dependent on structural class. The largest cavities in proteins are generally elongated rather than globular. There are many more empty cavities than hydrated cavities. The likelihood of a cavity being occupied by a water molecule increases with cavity size and the number of available hydrogen bond partners, with each additional partner typically stabilizing the occupied state by 0.6 kcal/mol.

  abstract = {Chemical shift perturbation (CSP, chemical shift mapping or complexation-induced changes in chemical shift, CIS) follows changes in the chemical shifts of a protein when a ligand is added, and uses these to determine the location of the binding site, the affinity of the ligand, and/or possibly the structure of the complex. A key factor in determining the appearance of spectra during a titration is the exchange rate between free and bound, or more specifically the off-rate koff. When koff is greater than the chemical shift difference between free and bound, which typically equates to an affinity Kd weaker than about 3 pM, then exchange is fast on the chemical shift timescale. Under these circumstances, the observed shift is the population-weighted average of free and bound, which allows Kd to be determined from measurement of peak positions, provided the measurements are made appropriately. 1H shifts are influenced to a large extent by through-space interactions, whereas 13Ca and 13Q? shifts are influenced more by through-bond effects. 15N and 13C shifts are influenced both by through-bond and by through-space (hydrogen bonding) interactions. For determining the location of a bound ligand on the basis of shift change, the most appropriate method is therefore usually to measure 15N HSQC spectra, calculate the geometrical distance moved by the peak, weighting 15N shifts by a factor of about 0.14 compared to 1H shifts, and select those residues for which the weighted shift change is larger than the standard deviation of the shift for all residues. Other methods are discussed, in particular the measurement of 13CH3 signals. Slow to intermediate exchange rates lead to line broadening, and make Kd values very difficult to obtain. There is no good way to distinguish changes in chemical shift due to direct binding of the ligand from changes in chemical shift due to allosteric change. Ligand binding at multiple sites can often be characterised, by simultaneous fitting of many measured shift changes, or more simply by adding substo- ichiometric amounts of ligand. The chemical shift changes can be used as restraints for docking ligand onto protein. By use of quantitative calculations of ligand-induced chemical shift changes, it is becoming possible to determine not just the position but also the orientation of ligands. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This method allows the investigation of local-global coupling, a more accurate estimation of vibrational free energy contribution for parts of a large system, and the elimination of the "tip effect" in elastic network model calculations. Additionally, the VSA method can be used as a probe of specific degrees of freedom that may contribute to free energy differences. The VSA approach can be employed in many ways, but it will likely be most useful for estimating activation free energies in QM/MM reaction path calculations.

The approach combines the benefits of Markov state models---clustering of high-dimensional spaces and modeling of complex many-state systems---with those of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio of exploiting biased or high-temperature ensembles to accelerate rare-event sampling. TRAM does not depend on any rate model in addition to the widely used Markov state model approximation, but uses only fundamental relations such as detailed balance and binless reweighting of configurations between ensembles. Previous methods, including the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, discrete TRAM, and Markov state models are special cases and can be derived from the TRAM equations. TRAM is demonstrated by efficiently computing MEMMs in cases where other estimators break down, including the full thermodynamics and rare-event kinetics from high-dimensional simulation data of an all-atom protein--ligand binding model.},

In Escherichia coli, asymmetric intermediates of GroEL are formed with the co-chaperonin GroES and nucleotides bound only to one of the seven-subunit rings (the cis ring) and not to the opposing ring (the trans ring). The structure of the GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 complex reveals how large en bloc movements of the cis ring's intermediate and apical domains enable bound GroES to stabilize a folding chamber with ADP confined to the cis ring. Elevation and twist of the apical domains double the volume of the central cavity and bury hydrophobic peptide-binding residues in the interface with GroES, as well as between GroEL subunits, leaving a hydrophilic cavity lining that is conducive to protein folding. An inward tilt of the cis equatorial domain causes an outward tilt in the trans ring that opposes the binding of a second GroES. When combined with new functional results, this negative allosteric mechanism suggests a model for an ATP-driven folding cycle that requires a double toroid.}

Some of these were designed to introduce new solvent-binding sites. Others were intended to displace solvent from preexisting sites. In one case Val-149 was replaced with alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, isoleucine, and glycine. Crystallographic analysis shows that, with the exception of isoleucine, each of these substitutions results in the binding of solvent at a polar site that is sterically blocked in the wild-type enzyme. Mutations designed to perturb or displace a solvent molecule present in the native enzyme included the replacement of Thr-152 with alanine, serine, cysteine, valine, and isoleucine. Although the solvent molecule was moved in some cases by up to 1.7 A, in no case was it completely removed from the folded protein. The results suggest that hydrogen bonds from the protein to bound solvent are energy neutral. The binding of solvent to internal sites within proteins also appears to be energy neutral except insofar as the bound solvent may prevent a loss of energy due to potential hydrogen bonding groups that would otherwise be unsatisfied. The introduction of a solvent-binding site appears to require not only a cavity to accommodate the water molecule but also the presence of polar groups to help satisfy its hydrogen-bonding potential. It may be easier to design a site to accommodate two or more water molecules rather than one as the solvent molecules can then hydrogen-bond to each other. For similar reasons it is often difficult to design a point mutation that will displace a single solvent molecule from the core of a protein.},

  abstract = {The rapid emergence of cross-resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) has become a serious problem in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Understanding the detailed molecular mechanism of INSTIs cross-resistance is therefore critical for the development of new effective therapy against cross-resistance. On the basis of the homology modeling constructed structure of tetrameric HIV-1 intasome, the detailed molecular mechanism of the cross-resistance mutation E138K/Q148K to three important INSTIs (Raltegravir (RAL, FDA approved in 2007), Elvitegravir (EVG, FDA approved in 2012), and Dolutegravir (DTG, phase III clinical trials)) was investigated by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and residue interaction network (RIN) analysis. The results from conformation analysis and binding free energy calculation can provide some useful information about the detailed binding mode and cross-resistance mechanism for the three INSTIs to HIV-1 intasome. Binding free energy decomposition analysis revealed that Pro145 residue in the 140s 1oop (Gly140 to Gly149) of the HIV-1 intasome had strong hydrophobic interactions with INSTIs and played an important role in the binding of INSTIs to HIV-1 intasome active site. A systematic comparison and analysis of the RIN proves that the communications between the residues in the resistance mutant is increased when compared with that of the wild-type HIV-1 intasome. Further analysis indicates that residue Pro145 may play an important role and is relevant to the structure rearrangement in HIV-1 intasome active site. In addition, the chelating ability of the oxygen atoms in INSTIs (e.g., RAL and EVG) to Mg2+ in the active site of the mutated intasome was reduced due to this conformational change and is also responsible for the cross-resistance mechanism. Notably, the cross-resistance mechanism we proposed could give some important information for the future rational design of novel INSTIs overcoming cross-resistance. Furthermore, the combination use of molecular dynamics simulation and residue interaction network analysis can be generally applicable to investigate drug resistance mechanism for other biomolecular systems. {\copyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.}

Preliminary and partial results of the study have been already published (Yoshida, N. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 12042-12043). The calculation was carried out for aqueous solutions of three different electrolytes, CaCh, NaCl, and KCl, and for four different mutants of the human lysozyme: wild type, Q86D, A92D, and Q86D/A92D, which have been studied experimentally. The discussion of this article focuses on the cleft that consists of amino acid residues from Q86 to A92. For the wild type of protein in the aqueous solutions of all the electrolytes studied, there are no distributions observed for the ions inside the cleft. The Q86D mutant shows essentially the same behavior with that of the wild type. The A92D mutant shows strong binding ability to Na+ in the recognition site, which is in accord with the experimental results. There are two isomers of the Q86D/A92D mutant, e.g., apo-Q86D/A92D and holo-Q86D/A92D. Although both isomers exhibit the binding ability to the Na+ and Ca2+ ions, the holo isomer shows much greater affinity compared with the apo isomer. Regarding the selective ion binding of the holo-Q86D/A92D mutant, it shows greater affinity to Ca2+ than to Na+, which is also consistent with the experimental observation. {\copyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.}

Bya coupling parameter integration it is shown that only averages over the solute-solvent interaction energy contribute to the free energy and that the solvent-solvent interaction term, which contributes the so-called cavity (solvent reorganization) term to the energy, is cancelled exactly by a corresponding term in the entropy. These terms exist even in the infinite dilution limit since they arise from the derivative of the free energy with respect to the solute density. Following the approach of Garisto et 01. [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 6294 (1983)], the site-site Ornstein-Zernike integral equations and HNC closures are used to determine the derivatives of the distribution functions with respect to the density. This makes it possible to calculate the energetic and entropic contributions to the solvation free energy in the infinite dilution limit. The method is applied to pure solvent and to infinitely dilute aqueous solutions of cations, anions and neutral Lennard-Jones particles. The results are in agreement with numerical calculations of the thermodynamic quantities by use of finite difference values for the temperature derivatives. A simple empirical relation for the charge dependence of the solvation free energy is observed; it is shown for the case of an ion in a dipolar solvent, as typified by aqueous electrolyte solutions, that the free energy of solvation varies quadratically with the charge and is very nearly equal to one-halfthe solute-solvent portion of the solvation energy.

Typically receptor-based pharmacophore modeling methods only consider a single or limited number of receptor conformations and map out the favorable binding patterns in vacuum or with a limited representation of the aqueous solvent environment, such that they may suffer from neglect of protein flexibility and desolvation effects. Site-Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) is an approach that takes into account these, as well as other, properties to determine 3-dimensional maps of the functional group-binding patterns on a target receptor (i.e. FragMaps). In this study, a method to use the FragMaps to automatically generate receptor-based pharmacophore models is presented. It converts the FragMaps into SILCS pharmacophore features including aromatic, aliphatic, hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor chemical functionalities. The method generates multiple pharmacophore hypotheses that are then quantitatively ranked using SILCS grid free energies. The pharmacophore model generation protocol is validated using three different protein targets, including using the resulting models in virtual screening. Improved performance and efficiency of the SILCS derived pharmacophore models as compared to published docking studies, as well as a recently developed receptor-based pharmacophore modeling method is shown, indicating the potential utility of the approach in rational drug design. {\copyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease, originating from the intrinsically disordered peptide {$\alpha$}-synuclein, is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 5\% of the population above age 85. It remains unclear how {$\alpha$}-synuclein monomers undergo conformational changes leading to aggregation and formation of fibrils characteristic for the disease. In the present study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations (over 180 {$\mu$}s in aggregated time) using a hybrid-resolution model, Proteins with Atomic details in Coarse-grained Environment (PACE), to characterize in atomic detail structural ensembles of wild type and mutant monomeric {$\alpha$}-synuclein in aqueous solution. The simulations reproduce structural properties of {$\alpha$}-synuclein characterized in experiments, such as secondary structure content, long-range contacts, chemical shifts, and 3J(HNHC{$\alpha$})-coupling constants. Most notably, the simulations reveal that a short fragment encompassing region 38-53, adjacent to the non-amyloid-{$\beta$} component region, exhibits a high probability of forming a {$\beta$}-hairpin; this fragment, when isolated from the remainder of {$\alpha$}-synuclein, fluctuates frequently into its {$\beta$}-hairpin conformation. Two disease-prone mutations, namely, A30P and A53T, significantly accelerate the formation of a {$\beta$}-hairpin in the stated fragment. We conclude that the formation of a {$\beta$}-hairpin in region 38-53 is a key event during {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation. We predict further that the G47V mutation impedes the formation of a turn in the {$\beta$}-hairpin and slows down {$\beta$}-hairpin formation, thereby retarding {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation.}

  abstract = {Receptor-based pharmacophore modeling is an efficient computer-aided drug design technique that uses the structure of the target protein to identify novel leads. However, most methods consider protein flexibility and desolvation effects in a very approximate way, which may limit their use in practice. The Site-Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) assisted pharmacophore modeling protocol (SILCS-Pharm) was introduced recently to address these issues, as SILCS naturally takes both protein flexibility and desolvation effects into account by using full molecular dynamics simulations to determine 3D maps of the functional group-affinity patterns on a target receptor. In the present work, the SILCS-Pharm protocol is extended to use a wider range of probe molecules including benzene, propane, methanol, formamide, acetaldehyde, methylammonium, acetate and water. This approach removes the previous ambiguity brought by using water as both the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor probe molecule. The new SILCS-Pharm protocol is shown to yield improved screening results, as compared to the previous approach based on three target proteins. Further validation of the new protocol using five additional protein targets showed improved screening compared to those using common docking methods, further indicating improvements brought by the explicit inclusion of additional feature types associated with the wider collection of probe molecules in the SILCS simulations. The advantage of using complementary features and volume constraints, based on exclusion maps of the protein defined from the SILCS simulations, is presented. In addition, reranking using SILCS-based ligand grid free energies is shown to enhance the diversity of identified ligands for the majority of targets. These results suggest that the SILCS-Pharm protocol will be of utility in rational drug design.},

Structural elucidation of sHsp-substrate complexes has been hampered by the transient and heterogeneous nature of their interactions, and the precise mechanisms underlying substrate recognition, promiscuity, and chaperone activity of sHsps remain unclear. Here we show the formation of a stable complex between Arabidopsis thaliana plastid sHsp, Hsp21, and its natural substrate 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) under heat stress, and report cryo-electron microscopy structures of Hsp21, DXPS and Hsp21-DXPS complex at near-atomic resolution. Monomeric Hsp21 binds across the dimer interface of DXPS and engages in multivalent interactions by recognizing highly dynamic structural elements in DXPS. Hsp21 partly unfolds its central {$\alpha$}-crystallin domain to facilitate binding of DXPS, which preserves a native-like structure. This mode of interaction suggests a mechanism of sHsps anti-aggregation activity towards a broad range of substrates.},

However, in the Michaelis enzyme-substrate complex, no direct function has been attributed to this residue.  Two mutants with substitutions of this residue in TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase (Lys-244 and Ser-244) were prepd. to explore whether the guanidinium group of Arg-244 plays a crit. role in the turnover processes.  The mutant enzymes were effective catalysts for the hydrolysis of both penicillins and cephalosporins, and the Lys-244 mutant enzyme behaved virtually identically to the wild-type {$\beta$}-lactamase.  Comparative kinetic characterization of the Ser-244 mutant and wild-type enzymes attributed binding energies of 1.3-2.3 kcal/mol for the penicillins and 0.3-1.0 kcal/mol for the cephalosporins to the transition-state species by Arg-244.  Furthermore, it was shown that Arg-244 also contributes equally well to ground-state binding stabilization.  These results were interpreted to indicate the involvement of a long H-bond between Arg-244 and the substrate carboxylate, both in the ground and transition states.  A reassessed picture for substrate anchoring involving interactions of the substrate carboxylate with the side-chains of Ser-130, Ser-235, and Arg-244 is proposed to accommodate these observations.

  abstract = {Background: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions. Results: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {$>$}-1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 {\AA} for RMSD. Conclusion: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations.

Enhanced sampling techniques aim to alleviate this issue by accelerating conformational transitions, yet they typically necessitate well-defined collective variables (CVs), posing a significant challenge. Machine learning offers promising solutions but typically requires rich training data encompassing the entire free energy surface (FES). In this work, we introduce an automated iterative pipeline designed to mitigate these limitations. Our protocol first utilizes a CV-free count-based adaptive sampling method to generate a data set rich in rare events. From this data set, slow modes are identified using Koopman-reweighted time-lagged independent component analysis (KTICA), which are subsequently leveraged by on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling (OPES) to efficiently explore the FES. The effectiveness of our pipeline is demonstrated and further compared with the common Markov State Model (MSM) approach on two model systems with increasing complexity: alanine dipeptide (Ala2) and deca-alanine (Ala10), underscoring its applicability across diverse biomolecular simulations.}

  abstract = {Free-energy calculations in multiple dimensions constitute a challenging problem, owing to the significant computational cost incurred to achieve ergodic sampling. The generalized adaptive biasing force (gABF) algorithm calculates n one-dimensional lists of biasing forces to approximate the n-dimensional matrix by ignoring the coupling terms ordinarily taken into account in classical ABF simulations, thereby greatly accelerating sampling in the multidimensional space. This approximation may however occasionally lead to poor, incomplete exploration of the conformational space compared to classical ABF, especially when the selected coarse variables are strongly coupled. It has been found that introducing extended potentials coupled to the coarse variables of interest can virtually eliminate this shortcoming, and, thus, improve the efficiency of gABF simulations. In the present contribution, we propose a new free-energy method, coined extended generalized ABF (egABF), combining gABF with an extended Lagrangian strategy. The results for three illustrative examples indicate that (i) egABF can explore the transition coordinate much more efficiently compared with classical ABF, eABF, and gABF, in both simple and complex cases and (ii) egABF can achieve a higher accuracy than gABF, with a root mean-squared deviation between egABF and eABF free-energy profiles on the order of kBT. Furthermore, the new egABF algorithm outruns the previous ABF-based algorithms in high-dimensional free-energy calculations and, hence, represents a powerful importance-sampling alternative for the investigation of complex chemical and biological processes.},

Using extensive ({$\sim$}50 {$\mu$}s) explicit solvent atomistic simulations and Markov state analysis, we shed new lights on the mechanism of this transition in the apo form of AK. The closed basin of apo AK features an open NMP domain while the LID domain closes and rotates toward it. Therefore, although the computed structural properties of the closed ensemble are consistent with previously reported FRET and PRE measurements, our simulations suggest that NMP closure is likely to follow AMP binding, in contrast to the previous interpretation of FRET and PRE data that the apo state was able to sample the fully closed conformation for ``ligand selection''. The closed state ensemble is found to be kinetically heterogeneous; multiple pathways and time scales are associated with the open/close transition, providing new clues to the disparate time scales observed in different experiments. Besides interdomain interactions, a novel mutual information analysis identifies specific intradomain interactions that correlate strongly to transition kinetics, supporting observations from previous chimera experiments. While our results underscore the role of internal domain properties in determining the kinetics of open/close transition in apo AK, no evidence is observed for any significant degree of local unfolding during the transition. These observations about AK have general implications to our view of conformational states, transition pathways, and time scales of conformational changes in proteins. The key features and time scales of observed transition pathways are robust and similar from simulations using two popular fixed charge force fields.},

This sampling issue is particularly severe when the collective variable is defined in a low-dimension subset of the target system; then the ``Hamiltonian lagging'' problem, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the move of the collective variable, may be likely to occur. To overcome this problem in equilibrium conformational sampling, we adopted the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) strategy, which was originally developed in the context of free energy simulation [L. Zheng, M. Chen, and W. Yang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.\hphantom{,}105, 20227 (2008)]. Thereby, generalized ensemble simulations can simultaneously escape both the explicit barriers along the collective variable direction and the hidden barriers that are strongly coupled with the collective variable move.

  abstract = {Protein-DNA complexes play crucial roles in gene regulation. The prediction of the residues involved in protein-DNA interactions is critical for understanding gene regulation. Although many methods have been proposed, most of them overlooked motif features. Motif features are sub sequences and are important for the recognition between a protein and DNA. In order to efficiently use motif features for the prediction of DNA-binding residues, we first apply the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method to capture the motif features from the sequences around the target residues. CNN modeling consists of a set of learnable motif detectors that can capture the important motif features by scanning the sequences around the target residues. Then we use a neural network classifier, referred to as CNNsite, by combining the captured motif features, sequence features and evolutionary features to predict binding residues from sequences. The datasets PDNA-62 and PDNA-224 are used to evaluate the performance of CNNsite by five-fold cross-validation. Performance evaluation shows that the motif features performs better than sequence features and evolutionary features with at least 6.73\% on ST, 0.097 on MCC and 0.069 on AUC. When comparing with previously published methods, CNNsite performs better with at least 0.019 on MCC, 4.37\% on ST and 0.040 on AUC. CNNsite is also evaluated on an independent dataset TS-72 and CNNsite outperforms the previous methods by at least 0.012 on AUC. The discriminant powers of the motif features of size from 2 to 6 residues show that many motif features with large discriminant power are composed by the residues that play important roles in the DNA-protein interactions.

  abstract = {The enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) is a key enzyme in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway and is a target for the development of antibiotics, herbicides, and antimalarial drugs. DXPS catalyzes the formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), a branch point metabolite in isoprenoid biosynthesis, and is also used in the biosynthesis of thiamin (vitamin B1) and pyridoxal (vitamin B6). Previously, we found that DXPS is unique among the superfamily of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes in stabilizing the predecarboxylation intermediate, C2-alpha-lactyl-thiamin diphosphate (LThDP), which has subsequent decarboxylation that is triggered by d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). Herein, we applied hydrogen--deuterium (H/D) exchange MS (HDX-MS) of full-length Escherichia coli DXPS to provide a snapshot of the conformational dynamics of this enzyme, leading to the following conclusions. (i) The high sequence coverage of DXPS allowed us to monitor structural changes throughout the entire enzyme, including two segments (spanning residues 183--238 and 292--317) not observed by X-ray crystallography. (ii) Three regions of DXPS (spanning residues 42--58, 183--199, and 278--298) near the active center displayed both EX1 (monomolecular) and EX2 (bimolecuar) H/D exchange (HDX) kinetic behavior in both ligand-free and ligand-bound states. All other peptides behaved according to the common EX2 kinetic mechanism. (iii) The observation of conformational changes on DXPS provides support for the role of conformational dynamics in the DXPS mechanism: The closed conformation of DXPS is critical for stabilization of LThDP, whereas addition of GAP converts DXPS to the open conformation that coincides with decarboxylation of LThDP and DXP release.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) are critical for viral replication and provide targets for antiviral drugs. Using the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model, we determined the crystal structure of an inactive PEDV 3CLpro variant (C144A) in complex with a peptide of NF-{$\kappa$}B essential modulator (NEMO227--233). Structural characterization showed that the conformational change to PEDV 3CLpro S1{$\prime$} pocket conferred tolerance for nonconventional P1{$\prime$}-Val from a NEMO peptide substrate, indicating strong substrate accommodation. Using a combination of classical and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we explored the free-energy landscapes associated with the acylation step of PEDV 3CLpro with regard to various substrates. The P1{$\prime$} site plays a key role in the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteolysis, and the S1{$\prime$} pocket might affect the free-energy cost of the acylation reaction. Our study provides structural insight into coronavirus 3CLpro-mediated cleavage and will inform the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.},

  abstract = {While being one of the most popular reaction rate theories, the applicability of transition state theory to the study of enzymatic reactions has been often challenged. The complex dynamic nature of the protein environment raised the question about the validity of the nonrecrossing hypothesis, a cornerstone in this theory. We present a computational strategy to quantify the error associated to transition state theory from the number of recrossings observed at the equicommittor, which is the best possible dividing surface. Application of a direct multidimensional transition state optimization to the hydride transfer step in human dihydrofolate reductase shows that both the participation of the protein degrees of freedom in the reaction coordinate and the error associated to the nonrecrossing hypothesis are small. Thus, the use of transition state theory, even with simplified reaction coordinates, provides a good theoretical framework for the study of enzymatic catalysis.},
