  abstract = {New therapies for leukemia are urgently needed due to adverse side effects, tumor resistance and lack of selectivity of many chemotherapeutic agents in clinical use. Ageratum conyzoides has been used in folklore medicine for managing leukemia and other cancers. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of fractions, sub-fractions and purified compounds from the ethanol leaf extracts of A. conyzoides against Jurkat cells-model for acute T cell leukemia. A two-dimensional purification process using normal phase flash, followed by reverse phase purification was necessary to isolate pure methoxy-flavones, which were further characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and MS-MS. The effect of fractions or pure compounds on cell viability was determined using either the MTT reagent or CellTiter-Blue{\textregistered} assay, while the caspase-3 and -7 activation was tested with Caspase-Glo{\textregistered} 3/7 assay. Prediction of compounds' drug disposition profiles in vivo was measured with biomimetic affinity chromatography methodologies.},

  abstract = {Since its inception nearly a half century ago, CHARMM has been playing a central role in computational biochemistry and biophysics. Commensurate with the developments in experimental research and advances in computer hardware, the range of methods and applicability of CHARMM have also grown. This review summarizes major developments that occurred after 2009 when the last review of CHARMM was published. They include the following: new faster simulation engines, accessible user interfaces for convenient workflows, and a vast array of simulation and analysis methods that encompass quantum mechanical, atomistic, and coarse-grained levels, as well as extensive coverage of force fields. In addition to providing the current snapshot of the CHARMM development, this review may serve as a starting point for exploring relevant theories and computational methods for tackling contemporary and emerging problems in biomolecular systems.

  abstract = {The bacterial metabolic enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate and Dglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-GAP). DXP is an essential bacteriaspecific metabolite that feeds into the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), and ThDP. DXPS catalyzes the activation of pyruvate to give the C2{$\alpha$}-lactylThDP (LThDP) adduct that is long-lived on DXPS in a closed state in the absence of the cosubstrate. Binding of D-GAP shifts the DXPS-LThDP complex to an open state which coincides with LThDP decarboxylation. This gated mechanism distinguishes DXPS in ThDP enzymology. How LThDP persists on DXPS in the absence of cosubstrate, while other pyruvate decarboxylases readily activate LThDP for decarboxylation, is a long-standing question in the field. We propose that an active site network functions to prevent LThDP activation on DXPS until the cosubstrate binds. Binding of D-GAP coincides with a conformational shift and disrupts the network causing changes in the active site that promote LThDP activation. Here, we show that the substitution of putative network residues, as well as nearby residues believed to contribute to network charge distribution, predictably affects LThDP reactivity. Substitutions predicted to disrupt the network have the effect to activate LThDP for decarboxylation, resulting in CO2 and acetate production. In contrast, a substitution predicted to strengthen the network fails to activate LThDP and has the effect to shift DXPS toward the closed state. Network-disrupting substitutions near the carboxylate of LThDP also have a pronounced effect to shift DXPS to an open state. These results offer initial insights to explain the long-lived LThDP intermediate and its activation through disruption of an active site network, which is unique to DXPS. These findings have important implications for DXPS function in bacteria and its development as an antibacterial target.},

  abstract = {A selection of antiviral compounds from the Drug Repurposing Hub were screened as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 protein targets using CIFDock, a flexible docking method. CIFDock allows for a fully flexible active site of the protein-ligand complex and retaining of explicit water molecules throughout docking simulations. This method provides a more thorough conformational space search than is attainable by rigid docking methods, and thus a more accurate representation of the binding interactions between these antiviral compounds and the SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. Four proteins critical to viral function were selected as targets of the study: the main protease (Mpro), the papain-like protease (PLpro), the transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2), and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). The results reveal potential SARS-CoV-2 viral inhibitors from this library of antivirals, based on favorable Glide scores of the docked protein-ligand poses. The antiviral compounds brecanavir, mozenavir, palinavir, sovaprevir, and telinavir yielded excellent binding scores across all protease targets. Additionally, these particular antivirals have not yet been investigated in clinical trials nor in vitro studies regarding COVID-19. Therefore, these compounds can be recommended for further research against SARS-CoV-2, based on extensive docking analysis with relevant protein targets.},
