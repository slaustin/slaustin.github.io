  abstract = {Analysis of extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in vacuo and in aqueous solution reveals that it is possible to separate the configurational space into two subspaces: (1) an ``essential'' subspace containing only a few degrees of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that comprises most of the positional fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian distribution and which can be considered as ``physically constrained.'' If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space. {\copyright} 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Collective protein structural transitions couple with fluctuations of their aqueous environment to enable biological function. Although decades of experiment have investigated protein-motion hydration couplings, atomistic details regarding global hydration structures and their transitions associated with large-scale protein motions have remained elusive. This knowledge gap has hindered computer aided drug design strategies which fail to account for protein and aqueous structural transitions in a physically rigorous manor. Consequently, the detection of hidden drug binding sites hypothesized to form during rare conformational transitions has proven to be exceedingly difficult. These elusive pockets are named cryptic sites, and are of immense therapeutic value due to their ability to couple to enzymatic active sites and allosterically modulate catalytic activity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations provide excellent spatial and temporal resolution to observe protein and hydration dynamics but struggle to adequately sample cryptic site formations. Over the past decade the Yang lab has worked to overcome this deficiency by developing the Orthogonal Space Tempering (OST) enhanced sampling technique, uniquely designed to accelerate rare conformational transitions of biomolecules and their environment. The focus of this dissertation is to enrich computational drug development by understanding how collective protein motions are coupled to the aqueous environment. Towards this goal, a novel toolkit of GPU-accelerated algorithms has been developed to 1) elucidate the hydration structure enveloping proteins, 2) reveal collective protein and water structural fluctuations, and 3) map causal dynamics throughout proteins and their environment. These algorithms are first utilized on the millisecond long MD simulation of Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI) performed by D. E. Shaw Research, one of the longest MD simulations performed to date. BPTI has been thoroughly investigated by biophysicists for decades and is known to harbor several buried water molecules, making it a fertile system to investigate hydration couplings. By application of our toolkit, we successfully characterize known conformational transitions of BPTI and elucidate how these motions are coupled to, and to an extent caused by, the aqueous environment. Next, OST is utilized to simulate TEM-1 {$\beta$}-lactamase, an enzyme that harbors a pair of cryptic sites capable of modulating the degradation of {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics, making it a valuable therapeutic target in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Application of our toolkit characterizes large scale motions of TEM-1 and its aqueous environment, including expansions of the cryptic site cavities and the active site, which are connected to each other by structural hydration linkages. We then reveal immense couplings between TEM-1 and aqueous conformational transitions and investigate causal dynamics among the cryptic sites, active site, and the environment. Through the culmination of these analysis, we identify a prospective cryptic site that is allosterically linked to the active site by collective hydration fluctuations. In summary, the work presented here provides a promising foundation to enrich computational drug development strategies by understanding the intimate relationship between proteins and the aqueous environment.},

These motions are more challenging to study than simple static structures. Here, we present evidence suggesting that in the enzyme adenylate kinase large ``hinge bending'' motions closely related to catalysis are regulated by intrinsic properties of the moving domains and not by their hinges, by anchoring domains, or by remote allosteric-like regions. From a pair of highly homologous mesophilic and thermophilic adenylate kinases, we generated a series of chimeric enzymes using a previously undescribed method with synthetic genes. Subsequent analysis of the chimeras has revealed unexpected spatial separation of stability and activity control. Our results highlight specific contributions of dynamics to catalysis in adenylate kinase. Furthermore, the overall strategy and the specific mutagenesis method used in this study can be generally applied.},

In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applications in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies to alleviate this difficulty.

Thermodynamically, changes in the aqueous environment affect the stability of biomolecules. Structurally, water participates chemically in the catalytic function of proteins and nucleic acids and physically in the collapse of the protein chain during folding through hydrophobic collapse and mediates binding through the hydrogen bond in complex formation. Water is a partner that slaves the dynamics of proteins, and water interaction with proteins affect their dynamics. Here we provide a review of the experimental and computational advances over the past decade in understanding the role of water in the dynamics, structure, and function of proteins. We focus on the combination of X-ray and neutron crystallography, NMR, terahertz spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and computer simulations to reveal how water assist proteins in their function. The recent advances in computer simulations and the enhanced sensitivity of experimental tools promise major advances in the understanding of protein dynamics, and water surely will be a protagonist.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen-deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a widely applied biophysical technique that probes the structure and dynamics of biomolecules without the need for site-directed modifications or bio-orthogonal labels. The mechanistic interpretation of HDX data, however, is often qualitative and subjective, owing to a lack of quantitative methods to rigorously translate observed deuteration levels into atomistic structural information. To help address this problem, we have developed a methodology to generate structural ensembles that faithfully reproduce HDX-MS measurements. In this approach, an ensemble of protein conformations is first generated, typically using molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-entropy bias is then applied post hoc to the resulting ensemble such that averaged peptide-deuteration levels, as predicted by an empirical model, agree with target values within a given level of uncertainty. We evaluate this approach, referred to as HDX ensemble reweighting (HDXer), for artificial target data reflecting the two major conformational states of a binding protein. We demonstrate that the information provided by HDX-MS experiments and by the model of exchange are sufficient to recover correctly weighted structural ensembles from simulations, even when the relevant conformations are rarely observed. Degrading the information content of the target data---e.g., by reducing sequence coverage, by averaging exchange levels over longer peptide segments, or by incorporating different sources of uncertainty---reduces the structural accuracy of the reweighted ensemble but still allows for useful insights into the distinctive structural features reflected by the target data. Finally, we describe a quantitative metric to rank candidate structural ensembles according to their correspondence with target data and illustrate the use of HDXer to describe changes in the conformational ensemble of the membrane protein LeuT. In summary, HDXer is designed to facilitate objective structural interpretations of HDX-MS data and to inform experimental approaches and further developments of theoretical exchange models.},

DXP is not utilized by humans; hence, DXPS has been an attractive antibacterial target. Here, we investigate DXPS from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrDXPS), showing that it has similar kinetic parameters Kmd-GAP and Kmpyruvate (54 {\textpm} 3 and 11 {\textpm} 1 {$\mu$}m, respectively) and comparable catalytic activity (kcat = 45 {\textpm} 2 min-1) with previously studied bacterial DXPS enzymes and employing it to obtain missing structural data on this enzyme family. In particular, we have determined crystallographic snapshots of DrDXPS in two states along the reaction coordinate: a structure of DrDXPS bound to C2{$\alpha$}-phosphonolactylThDP (PLThDP), mimicking the native pre-decarboxylation intermediate C2{$\alpha$}-lactylThDP (LThDP), and a native post-decarboxylation state with a bound enamine intermediate. The 1.94-{\AA}-resolution structure of PLThDP-bound DrDXPS delineates how two active-site histidine residues stabilize the LThDP intermediate. Meanwhile, the 2.40-{\AA}-resolution structure of an enamine intermediate-bound DrDXPS reveals how a previously unknown 17-{\AA} conformational change removes one of the two histidine residues from the active site, likely triggering LThDP decarboxylation to form the enamine intermediate. These results provide insight into how the bi-substrate enzyme DXPS limits side reactions by arresting the reaction on the less reactive LThDP intermediate when its cosubstrate is absent. They also offer a molecular basis for previous low-resolution experimental observations that correlate decarboxylation of LThDP with protein conformational changes.},

Considering the tremendous degree of success, including recognition by a 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are there still ``burning challenges'' in QM/MM methods, especially for biomolecular systems? In this short Perspective, we discuss several issues that we believe greatly impact the robustness and quantitative applicability of QM/MM simulations to many, if not all, biomolecules. We highlight these issues with observations and relevant advances from recent studies in our group and others in the field. Despite such limited scope, we hope the discussions are of general interest and will stimulate additional developments that help push the field forward in meaningful directions.},

  abstract = {Dynamic properties are functionally important in many proteins, including the enzyme adenylate kinase (AK), for which the open/closed transition limits the rate of catalytic turnover. Here, we compare our previously published coarse-grained (double-well Go{\textasciimacron} ) simulation of mesophilic AK from E. coli (AKmeso) to simulations of thermophilic AK from Aquifex aeolicus (AKthermo). In AKthermo, as with AKmeso, the LID domain prefers to close before the NMP domain in the presence of ligand, but LID rigid-body flexibility in the open (O) ensemble decreases significantly. Backbone foldedness in O and/or transition state (TS) ensembles increases significantly relative to AKmeso in some interdomain backbone hinges and within LID. In contact space, the TS of AKthermo has fewer contacts at the CORE-LID interface but a stronger contact network surrounding the CORE-NMP interface than the TS of AKmeso. A ``heated'' simulation of AKthermo at 375K slightly increases LID rigid-body flexibility in accordance with the ``corresponding states'' hypothesis. Furthermore, while computational mutation of 7 prolines in AKthermo to their AKmeso counterparts produces similar small perturbations, mutation of these sites, especially positions 8 and 155, to glycine is required to achieve LID rigid-body flexibility and hinge flexibilities comparable to AKmeso. Mutating the 7 sites to proline in AKmeso reduces some hinges' flexibilities, especially hinge 2, but does not reduce LID rigid-body flexibility, suggesting that these two types of motion are decoupled in AKmeso. In conclusion, our results suggest that hinge flexibility and global functional motions alike are correlated with but not exclusively determined by the hinge residues. This mutational framework can inform the rational design of functionally important flexibility and allostery in other proteins toward engineering novel biochemical pathways.},

We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles and {$\psi$} in N-acetylalanyl- N{$\prime$} -methylamide as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives. {\copyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AdK) is a small, monomeric enzyme that synchronizes the catalytic step with the enzyme's conformational dynamics to optimize a phosphoryl transfer reaction and the subsequent release of the product. Guided by experimental measurements of low catalytic activity in seven single-point mutation AdK variants (K13Q, R36A, R88A, R123A, R156K, R167A, and D158A), we utilized classical mechanical simulations to probe mutant dynamics linked to product release, and quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical calculations to compute a free energy barrier for the catalytic event. The goal was to establish a mechanistic connection between the two activities. Our calculations of the free energy barriers in AdK variants were in line with those from experiments, and conformational dynamics consistently demonstrated an enhanced tendency toward enzyme opening. This indicates that the catalytic residues in the wild-type AdK serve a dual role in this enzyme's function-one to lower the energy barrier for the phosphoryl transfer reaction and another to delay enzyme opening, maintaining it in a catalytically active, closed conformation for long enough to enable the subsequent chemical step. Our study also discovers that while each catalytic residue individually contributes to facilitating the catalysis, R36, R123, R156, R167, and D158 are organized in a tightly coordinated interaction network and collectively modulate AdK's conformational transitions. Unlike the existing notion of product release being rate-limiting, our results suggest a mechanistic interconnection between the chemical step and the enzyme's conformational dynamics acting as the bottleneck of the catalytic process. Our results also suggest that the enzyme's active site has evolved to optimize the chemical reaction step while slowing down the overall opening dynamics of the enzyme.},

To explore the effect of external fluctuations on protein dynamics, we measure the fluctuations in the bulk solvent and the hydration shell with broadband dielectric spectroscopy and compare them with internal fluctuations measured with the M{\"o}ssbauer effect and neutron scattering. The result is clear. Large-scale protein motions are slaved to the fluctuations in the bulk solvent. They are controlled by the solvent viscosity, and are absent in a solid environment. Internal protein motions are slaved to the beta fluctuations of the hydration shell, are controlled by hydration, and are absent in a dehydrated protein. The model quantitatively predicts the rapid increase of the mean-square displacement above {$\approx$}200 K, shows that the external beta fluctuations determine the temperature- and time-dependence of the passage of carbon monoxide through myoglobin, and explains the nonexponential time dependence of the protein relaxation after photodissociation.},

  abstract = {Proper use of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) algorithm in free-energy calculations needs certain prerequisites to be met, namely, that the Jacobian for the metric transformation and its first derivative be available and the coarse variables be independent and fully decoupled from any holonomic constraint or geometric restraint, thereby limiting singularly the field of application of the approach. The extended ABF (eABF) algorithm circumvents these intrinsic limitations by applying the time-dependent bias onto a fictitious particle coupled to the coarse variable of interest by means of a stiff spring. However, with the current implementation of eABF in the popular molecular dynamics engine NAMD, a trajectory-based post-treatment is necessary to derive the underlying free-energy change. Usually, such a posthoc analysis leads to a decrease in the reliability of the free-energy estimates due to the inevitable loss of information, as well as to a drop in efficiency, which stems from substantial read-write accesses to file systems. We have developed a user-friendly, on-the-fly code for performing eABF simulations within NAMD. In the present contribution, this code is probed in eight illustrative examples. The performance of the algorithm is compared with traditional ABF, on the one hand, and the original eABF implementation combined with a posthoc analysis, on the other hand. Our results indicate that the on-the-fly eABF algorithm (i) supplies the correct free-energy landscape in those critical cases where the coarse variables at play are coupled to either each other or to geometric restraints or holonomic constraints, (ii) greatly improves the reliability of the free-energy change, compared to the outcome of a posthoc analysis, and (iii) represents a negligible additional computational effort compared to regular ABF. Moreover, in the proposed implementation, guidelines for choosing two parameters of the eABF algorithm, namely the stiffness of the spring and the mass of the fictitious particles, are proposed. The present on-the-fly eABF implementation can be viewed as the second generation of the ABF algorithm, expected to be widely utilized in the theoretical investigation of recognition and association phenomena relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract = {ConspectusThe observation of complex structural transitions in biological and abiological molecular objects within time scales amenable to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is often hampered by significant free energy barriers associated with entangled movements. Importance-sampling algorithms, a powerful class of numerical schemes for the investigation of rare events, have been widely used to extend simulations beyond the time scale common to MD. However, probing processes spanning milliseconds through microsecond molecular simulations still constitutes in practice a daunting challenge because of the difficulty of taming the ruggedness of multidimensional free energy surfaces by means of naive transition coordinates. To address this limitation, in recent years we have elaborated importance-sampling methods relying on an adaptive biasing force (ABF). In this Account, we review recent developments of algorithms aimed at mapping rugged free energy landscapes that correspond to complex processes of physical, chemical, and biological relevance. Through these developments, we have broadened the spectrum of applications of the popular ABF algorithm while improving its computational efficiency, notably for multidimensional free energy calculations. One major algorithmic advance, coined meta-eABF, merges the key features of metadynamics and an extended Lagrangian variant of ABF (eABF) by simultaneously shaving the barriers and flooding the valleys of the free energy landscape, and it possesses a convergence rate up to 5-fold greater than those of other importance-sampling algorithms. Through faster convergence and enhanced ergodic properties, meta-eABF represents a significant step forward in the simulation of millisecond-time-scale events. Here we introduce extensions of the algorithm, notably its well-tempered and replica-exchange variants, which further boost the sampling efficiency while gaining in numerical stability, thus allowing quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical free energy calculations to be performed at a lower cost. As a paradigm to bridge microsecond simulations to millisecond events by means of free energy calculations, we have applied the ABF family of algorithms to decompose complex movements in molecular objects of biological and abiological nature. We show here how water lubricates the shuttling of an amide-based rotaxane by altering the mechanism that underlies the concerted translation and isomerization of the macrocycle. Introducing novel collective variables in a computational workflow for the rigorous determination of standard binding free energies, we predict with utmost accuracy the thermodynamics of protein--ligand reversible association. Because of their simplicity, versatility, and robust mathematical foundations, the algorithms of the ABF family represent an appealing option for the theoretical investigation of a broad range of problems relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate--enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent `closed' state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.},

Therefore, we apply enhanced sampling algorithms along with adaptive path collective variables (PCVs), which converge to the minimum free energy path (MFEP) during the simulation. We show how PCVs can be combined with the highly efficient well-tempered metadynamics extended-system adaptive biasing force (WTM-eABF) hybrid sampling algorithm, offering dramatically increased sampling efficiency due to its fast adaptation to path updates. For this purpose, we address discontinuities of PCVs that can arise due to path shortcutting or path updates with a novel stabilization algorithm for extendedsystem methods. In addition, we show how the convergence of simulations can be further accelerated by utilizing the multistate Bennett's acceptance ratio (MBAR) estimator. These methods are applied to the first step of the enzymatic reaction mechanism of pseudouridine synthases, where the ability of path WTM-eABF to efficiently explore intricate molecular transitions is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The bacterial adhesin FimH consists of an allosterically regulated mannose-binding lectin domain and a covalently linked inhibitory pilin domain. Under normal conditions, the two domains are bound to each other, and FimH interacts weakly with mannose. However, under tensile force, the domains separate and the lectin domain undergoes conformational changes that strengthen its bond with mannose. Comparison of the crystallographic structures of the low and the high affinity state of the lectin domain reveals conformational changes mainly in the regulatory inter-domain region, the mannose binding site and a large {$\beta$} sheet that connects the two distally located regions. Here, molecular dynamics simulations investigated how conformational changes are propagated within and between different regions of the lectin domain. It was found that the inter-domain region moves towards the high affinity conformation as it becomes more compact and buries exposed hydrophobic surface after separation of the pilin domain. The mannose binding site was more rigid in the high affinity state, which prevented water penetration into the pocket. The large central {$\beta$} sheet demonstrated a soft spring-like twisting. Its twisting motion was moderately correlated to fluctuations in both the regulatory and the binding region, whereas a weak correlation was seen in a direct comparison of these two distal sites. The results suggest a so called ``population shift'' model whereby binding of the lectin domain to either the pilin domain or mannose locks the {$\beta$} sheet in a rather twisted or flat conformation, stabilizing the low or the high affinity state, respectively.

The landscape illustrates individual valleys, which are the conformational substates. From the functional standpoint, there are two key points: first, all functionally relevant substates pre-exist; and second, the landscape is dynamic and the relative populations of the substates will change following allosteric events. Allosteric events perturb the structure, and the energetic strain propagates and shifts the population. This can lead to changes in the shapes and properties of target binding sites. Here we present an overview of dynamic conformational ensembles focusing on allosteric events in signaling. We propose that combining equilibrium fluctuation concepts with genomic screens could help drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Conformational sampling of complex biomolecules is an emerging frontier in drug discovery. Advances in lab-based structural biology and related computational approaches like AlphaFold have made great strides in obtaining static protein structures for biologically relevant targets. However, biology is in constant motion, and many important biological processes rely on conformationally driven events. Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations run on standard hardware are impractical for many drug design projects, where conformationally driven biological events can take microseconds to milliseconds or longer. An alternative approach is to focus the search on a limited region of conformational space defined by a putative reaction coordinate (i.e., path collective variable). The search space is typically limited by applying restraints, which can be guided by insights about the underlying biological process of interest. The challenge is striking a balance between the degree to which the system is constrained and still allowing for natural motions along the path. A plethora of restraints exist to limit the size of conformational search space, although each has drawbacks when simulating complex biological motions. In this work, we present a three-stage procedure to construct realistic path collective variables (PCVs) and introduce a new kind of barrier restraint that is particularly well suited for complex conformationally driven biological events, such as allosteric modulations and conformational signaling. The PCV presented here is all-atom (as opposed to C-alpha or backbone only) and is derived from all-atom MD trajectory frames. The new restraint relies on a barrier function (specifically, the scaled reciprocal function), which we show is particularly beneficial in the context of molecular dynamics, where near-hard-wall restraints are needed with zero tolerance to restraint violation. We have implemented our PCV and barrier restraint within a hybrid sampling framework that combines well-tempered metadynamics and extended-Lagrangian adaptive biasing force (meta-eABF). We use three particular examples of high pharmaceutical interest to demonstrate the value of this approach: (1) sampling the distance from ubiquitin to a protein of interest within the supramolecular cullin--RING ligase complex, (2) stabilizing the wild-type conformation of the oncogenic mutant JAK2-V617F pseudokinase domain, and (3) inducing an activated state of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein observed upon ligand binding. For examples 2 and 3, we present statistical analysis of meta-eABF free energy estimates and, for each case, code for reproducing this work.},

  abstract = {Proteins can bind target molecules through either induced fit or conformational selection pathways. In the conformational selection model, a protein samples a scarcely populated high-energy state that resembles a target-bound conformation. In enzymatic catalysis, such high-energy states have been identified as crucial entities for activity and the dynamic interconversion between ground states and high-energy states can constitute the rate-limiting step for catalytic turnover. The transient nature of these states has precluded direct observation of their properties. Here, we present a molecular description of a high-energy enzyme state in a conformational selection pathway by an experimental strategy centered on NMR spectroscopy, protein engineering, and X-ray crystallography. Through the introduction of a disulfide bond, we succeeded in arresting the enzyme adenylate kinase in a closed high-energy conformation that is on-pathway for catalysis. A 1.9-{\AA} X-ray structure of the arrested enzyme in complex with a transition state analog shows that catalytic sidechains are properly aligned for catalysis. We discovered that the structural sampling of the substrate free enzyme corresponds to the complete amplitude that is associated with formation of the closed and catalytically active state. In addition, we found that the trapped high-energy state displayed improved ligand binding affinity, compared with the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that substrate binding to the high-energy state is not occluded by steric hindrance. Finally, we show that quenching of fast time scale motions observed upon ligand binding to adenylate kinase is dominated by enzyme--substrate interactions and not by intramolecular interactions resulting from the conformational change.},

  abstract = {High binding affinity and selectivity of metal ions are essential to the function of metalloproteins. Thus, understanding the factors that determine these binding characteristics is of major interest for both fundamental mechanistic investigations and guiding of the design of novel metalloproteins. In this work, we perform QM cluster model calculations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energy simulations to understand the binding selectivity of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the wild-type carp parvalbumin and its mutant. While a nonpolarizable MM model (CHARMM36) does not lead to the correct experimental trend, treatment of the metal binding site with the DFTB3 model in a QM/MM framework leads to relative binding free energies ({$\Delta\Delta$}Gbind) comparable with experimental data. For the wild-type (WT) protein, the calculated {$\Delta\Delta$}Gbind is {$\sim$}6.6 kcal/mol in comparison with the experimental value of 5.6 kcal/mol. The good agreement highlights the value of a QM description of the metal binding site and supports the role of electronic polarization and charge transfer to metal binding selectivity. For the D51A/E101D/F102W mutant, different binding site models lead to considerable variations in computed binding affinities. With a coordination number of seven for Ca2+, which is shown by QM/MM metadynamics simulations to be the dominant coordination number for the mutant, the calculated relative binding affinity is {$\sim$}4.8 kcal/mol, in fair agreement with the experimental value of 1.6 kcal/mol. The WT protein is observed to feature a flexible binding site that accommodates a range of coordination numbers for Ca2+, which is essential to the high binding selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+. In the mutant, the E101D mutation reduces the flexibility of the binding site and limits the dominant coordination number of Ca2+ to be seven, thereby leading to reduced binding selectivity against Mg2+. Our results highlight that the binding selectivity of metal ions depends on both the structural and dynamical properties of the protein binding site.},

Furthermore, the extended variables present a smoother, coarse-grain-like sampling problem on a mollified free energy surface, leading to faster exploration and convergence.

This is in contrast with other free energy sampling techniques which aim at mapping the full free energy landscape and whose cost increases exponentially with the number of collective variables kept in the free energy. Provided that the number of collective variables is large enough, the new technique captures the mechanism of transition in that it allows to determine the committor function for the reaction and, in particular, the transition state region. The new technique is illustrated on the example of alanine dipeptide, in which we compute the minimum free energy path for the isomerization transition using either two or four dihedral angles as collective variables. It is shown that the mechanism of transition can be captured using the four dihedral angles, but it cannot be captured using only two of them.},

  abstract = {Multimeric enzyme complexes are ubiquitous in nature and catalyze a broad range of useful biological transformations. They are often characterized by a tight allosteric coupling between subunits, making them highly inefficient when isolated. A good example is Tryptophan synthase (TrpS), an allosteric heterodimeric enzyme in the form of an {$\alpha\beta\beta\alpha$} complex that catalyzes the biosynthesis of Ltryptophan. In this study, we decipher the allosteric regulation existing in TrpS from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf TrpS), and how the allosteric conformational ensemble is recovered in laboratory-evolved stand-alone {$\beta$}-subunit variants.

  abstract = {Multimeric enzyme complexes are ubiquitous in nature and catalyze a broad range of useful biological transformations. They are often characterized by a tight allosteric coupling between subunits, making them highly inefficient when isolated. A good example is Tryptophan synthase (TrpS), an allosteric heterodimeric enzyme in the form of an {$\alpha\beta\beta\alpha$} complex that catalyzes the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan. In this study, we decipher the allosteric regulation existing in TrpS from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrpS), and how the allosteric conformational ensemble is recovered in laboratory-evolved stand-alone {$\beta$}-subunit variants. We find that recovering the conformational ensemble of a subdomain of TrpS affecting the relative stabilities of open, partially closed, and closed conformations is a prerequisite for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the {$\beta$}-subunit in the absence of its binding partner.

The use of the program is described with three proteins: 1YJP, 1O1O, and 1UFY. Source code is provided allowing CHARMMing to be downloaded, installed, and used by supercomputing centers and research groups that have a CHARMM license.

Because these changes have been studied by comparison of structures from different species, which share approximately one-third of their residues, only rough descriptions have been possible to date. Results We have solved the structure of unligated adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli at 2.2 {\aa} resolution and compared it with the high-resolution structure of the same enzyme ligated with an inhibitor mimicking both substrates, ATP and AMP. This comparison shows that, upon substrate binding, the enzyme increases its chain mobility in a region remote from the active center. As this region `solidifies' again on substrate release, we propose that it serves as a `counterweight' balancing the substrate binding energy. Conclusion The comparison of two very different conformations of the same polypeptide chain revealed kinematic details of the catalytic cycle. Moreover, it indicated that there exists an energetic counterweight compensating the substrate binding energy required for specificity. This counterweight prevents the enzyme from dropping into a rate-reducing energy well along the reaction coordinate.},

The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two copies of the complex, the structures of which agree well with each other. One of these copies is less well ordered in the crystals than the other, it shows generally higher temperature factors. The molecular packing in the crystals is discussed and correlated to crystal habit and anisotropic X-ray diffraction. The bound inhibitor simulates well the binding of substrates ATP and AMP, which are clearly assigned. The {$\alpha$}-phosphate of AMP is well positioned for a nucleophilic attack on the {$\gamma$}-phosphate of ATP. The observed structure readily allows the construction of a stabilized pentaco-ordinated transition state, as proposed for the known in-line mechanism of the enzyme, with nucleophile and leaving group in the apical positions of a trigonal bipyramid. The kinetic data of numerous mutations reported in the literature are correlated with the detailed structure of the enzyme. The mutants were classified. The concomitant increase of the Michaelis constants for ATP and AMP in the group of mutants that modify only the ATP-binding site cannot be explained.},

It exists in mainly two bound forms at the active site of the concerned enzyme: the internal aldimine, in which the PLP is bound with the {$\epsilon$}-amino group of lysine at the active site, and the external aldimine, where the PLP is bound to the substrate amino acid. Both the internal and external aldimines have Schiff base linkage (N--H--O) and can exist in two tautomeric structures of ketoenamine and enolimine forms. In this work, we have investigated the free energy landscape for the tautomeric proton transfer in the internal and external aldimines at the active site of the ornithine decarboxylase enzyme in an aqueous medium. We performed hybrid quantum-classical metadynamics and force field-based molecular dynamics simulations, which revealed that the ketoenamine tautomer is more stable than the enolimine form. The QM/MM metadynamics calculations show that the free energy difference between the ketoenamine and enolimine forms for the internal aldimine is 3.9 kcal/mol, and it is found to be 5.8 kcal/mol for the external aldimine, with the ketoenamine form being more stable in both cases. The results are further supported by calculations of the binding free energies from classical simulations and static quantum chemical calculations in different environments. We have also analyzed the configurational structure of the microenvironment at the active site in order to have better insights into the interactions of the active site residues with the PLP in its two tautomeric forms.},

  abstract = {The bacterial metabolic enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate and Dglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-GAP). DXP is an essential bacteriaspecific metabolite that feeds into the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), and ThDP. DXPS catalyzes the activation of pyruvate to give the C2{$\alpha$}-lactylThDP (LThDP) adduct that is long-lived on DXPS in a closed state in the absence of the cosubstrate. Binding of D-GAP shifts the DXPS-LThDP complex to an open state which coincides with LThDP decarboxylation. This gated mechanism distinguishes DXPS in ThDP enzymology. How LThDP persists on DXPS in the absence of cosubstrate, while other pyruvate decarboxylases readily activate LThDP for decarboxylation, is a long-standing question in the field. We propose that an active site network functions to prevent LThDP activation on DXPS until the cosubstrate binds. Binding of D-GAP coincides with a conformational shift and disrupts the network causing changes in the active site that promote LThDP activation. Here, we show that the substitution of putative network residues, as well as nearby residues believed to contribute to network charge distribution, predictably affects LThDP reactivity. Substitutions predicted to disrupt the network have the effect to activate LThDP for decarboxylation, resulting in CO2 and acetate production. In contrast, a substitution predicted to strengthen the network fails to activate LThDP and has the effect to shift DXPS toward the closed state. Network-disrupting substitutions near the carboxylate of LThDP also have a pronounced effect to shift DXPS to an open state. These results offer initial insights to explain the long-lived LThDP intermediate and its activation through disruption of an active site network, which is unique to DXPS. These findings have important implications for DXPS function in bacteria and its development as an antibacterial target.},

  abstract = {The bacterial metabolic enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (d-GAP). DXP is an essential bacteria-specific metabolite that feeds into the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), and ThDP. DXPS catalyzes the activation of pyruvate to give the C2{$\alpha$}-lactylThDP (LThDP) adduct that is long-lived on DXPS in a closed state in the absence of the cosubstrate. Binding of d-GAP shifts the DXPS-LThDP complex to an open state which coincides with LThDP decarboxylation. This gated mechanism distinguishes DXPS in ThDP enzymology. How LThDP persists on DXPS in the absence of cosubstrate, while other pyruvate decarboxylases readily activate LThDP for decarboxylation, is a long-standing question in the field. We propose that an active site network functions to prevent LThDP activation on DXPS until the cosubstrate binds. Binding of d-GAP coincides with a conformational shift and disrupts the network causing changes in the active site that promote LThDP activation. Here, we show that the substitution of putative network residues, as well as nearby residues believed to contribute to network charge distribution, predictably affects LThDP reactivity. Substitutions predicted to disrupt the network have the effect to activate LThDP for decarboxylation, resulting in CO2 and acetate production. In contrast, a substitution predicted to strengthen the network fails to activate LThDP and has the effect to shift DXPS toward the closed state. Network-disrupting substitutions near the carboxylate of LThDP also have a pronounced effect to shift DXPS to an open state. These results offer initial insights to explain the long-lived LThDP intermediate and its activation through disruption of an active site network, which is unique to DXPS. These findings have important implications for DXPS function in bacteria and its development as an antibacterial target.},

  abstract = {Atomistic simulations play a central role in many fields of science. However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.},

  abstract = {Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation is a popular enhanced sampling method that is widely used for exploring the atomic mechanism of protein conformational change. However, the requirement of huge computational resources for REMD, especially with the explicit solvent model, largely limits its application. In this study, the availability and efficiency of a variant of velocity-scaling REMD (vsREMD) was assessed with adenylate kinase as an example. Although vsREMD achieved results consistent with those from conventional REMD and experimental studies, the number of replicas required for vsREMD (30) was much less than that for conventional REMD (80) to achieve a similar acceptance rate (\$0.2), demonstrating high efficiency of vsREMD to characterize the protein conformational change and associated free-energy profile. Thus, vsREMD is a highly efficient approach for studying the large-scale conformational change of protein systems.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a severe infectious disease in need of new chemotherapies especially for drug-resistant cases. To meet the urgent requirement of new TB drugs with novel modes of action, the TB research community has been validating numerous targets from several biosynthetic pathways. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is utilized by Mtb for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the universal five-carbon building blocks of isoprenoids. While being a common biosynthetic pathway in pathogens, the MEP pathway is completely absent in humans. Due to its unique presence in pathogens as well as the essentiality of the MEP pathway in Mtb, the enzymes in this pathway are promising targets for the development of new drugs against tuberculosis. In this Review, we discuss three enzymes in the MEP pathway: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5phosphate reductoisomerase (IspC/DXR), and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), which appear to be the most promising antitubercular drug targets. Structural and mechanistic features of these enzymes are reviewed, as well as selected inhibitors that show promise as antitubercular agents.},

  abstract = {The enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) is a key enzyme in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway and is a target for the development of antibiotics, herbicides, and antimalarial drugs. DXPS catalyzes the formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), a branch point metabolite in isoprenoid biosynthesis, and is also used in the biosynthesis of thiamin (vitamin B1) and pyridoxal (vitamin B6). Previously, we found that DXPS is unique among the superfamily of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes in stabilizing the predecarboxylation intermediate, C2-alpha-lactyl-thiamin diphosphate (LThDP), which has subsequent decarboxylation that is triggered by d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). Herein, we applied hydrogen--deuterium (H/D) exchange MS (HDX-MS) of full-length Escherichia coli DXPS to provide a snapshot of the conformational dynamics of this enzyme, leading to the following conclusions. (i) The high sequence coverage of DXPS allowed us to monitor structural changes throughout the entire enzyme, including two segments (spanning residues 183--238 and 292--317) not observed by X-ray crystallography. (ii) Three regions of DXPS (spanning residues 42--58, 183--199, and 278--298) near the active center displayed both EX1 (monomolecular) and EX2 (bimolecuar) H/D exchange (HDX) kinetic behavior in both ligand-free and ligand-bound states. All other peptides behaved according to the common EX2 kinetic mechanism. (iii) The observation of conformational changes on DXPS provides support for the role of conformational dynamics in the DXPS mechanism: The closed conformation of DXPS is critical for stabilization of LThDP, whereas addition of GAP converts DXPS to the open conformation that coincides with decarboxylation of LThDP and DXP release.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) are critical for viral replication and provide targets for antiviral drugs. Using the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model, we determined the crystal structure of an inactive PEDV 3CLpro variant (C144A) in complex with a peptide of NF-{$\kappa$}B essential modulator (NEMO227--233). Structural characterization showed that the conformational change to PEDV 3CLpro S1{$\prime$} pocket conferred tolerance for nonconventional P1{$\prime$}-Val from a NEMO peptide substrate, indicating strong substrate accommodation. Using a combination of classical and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we explored the free-energy landscapes associated with the acylation step of PEDV 3CLpro with regard to various substrates. The P1{$\prime$} site plays a key role in the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteolysis, and the S1{$\prime$} pocket might affect the free-energy cost of the acylation reaction. Our study provides structural insight into coronavirus 3CLpro-mediated cleavage and will inform the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.},
