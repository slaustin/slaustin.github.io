abstract: Docking of the 5CITEP inhibitor to snapshots of a 2 ns HIV-1 integrase MD
  trajectory indicated a previously uncharacterized trench adjacent to the active
  site that intermittently opens. Further docking studies of novel ligands with the
  potential to bind to both regions showed greater selective affinity when able to
  bind to the trench. Our ranking of ligands is open to experimental testing, and
  our approach suggests a new target for HIV-1 therapeutics.
