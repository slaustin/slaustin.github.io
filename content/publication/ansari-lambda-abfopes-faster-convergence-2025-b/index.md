abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target macromolecules
  while combining both speed and accuracy is a cornerstone of modern computational
  drug discovery, which is critical for accelerating therapeutic development. Despite
  recent progress in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as advanced polarizable
  force fields and enhanced sampling techniques, estimating absolute binding free
  energies (ABFEs) remains computationally challenging. To overcome these difficulties,
  we introduce a highly efficient hybrid methodology that couples the Lambda-adaptive
  biasing force (Lambda-ABF) scheme with on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling
  (OPES). This approach achieves up to a 9-fold improvement in sampling efficiency
  and computational speed compared to the original Lambda-ABF when used in conjunction
  with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, yielding converged results at a fraction
  of the cost of standard techniques.
