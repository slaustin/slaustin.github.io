abstract: The Tyr35 $i̊ghtarrow$ Gly replacement in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
  (BPTI) has previously been shown to dramatically enhance the flexibility of the
  trypsin-binding region of the free inhibitor and to destabilize the interaction
  with the protease by about 3~kcal/mol. The effects of this replacement on the enzyme-inhibitor
  interaction were further studied here by X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration
  calorimetry (ITC). The co-crystal structure of Y35G BPTI bound to trypsin was determined
  using 1.65~Å resolution X-ray diffraction data collected from cryopreserved crystals,
  and a new structure of the complex with wild-type BPTI under the same conditions
  was determined using 1.62~Å data. These structures reveal that, in contrast to the
  free protein, Y35G BPTI adopts a conformation nearly identical with that of the
  wild-type protein, with a water-filled cavity in place of the missing Tyr side-chain.
  The crystallographic temperature factors for the two complexes indicate that the
  mutant inhibitor is nearly as rigid as the wild-type protein when bound to trypsin.
  Calorimetric measurements show that the change in enthalpy upon dissociation of
  the complex is 2.5~kcal/mol less favorable for the complex containing Y35G BPTI
  than for the complex with the wild-type inhibitor. Thus, the destabilization of
  the complex resulting from the Y35G replacement is due to a more favorable change
  in entropy upon dissociation. The heat capacity changes for dissociation of the
  mutant and wild-type complexes were very similar, suggesting that the entropic effects
  probably do not arise from solvation effects, but are more likely due to an increase
  in protein conformational entropy upon dissociation of the mutant inhibitor. These
  results define the biophysical role of a highly conserved core residue located outside
  of a protein-binding interface, demonstrating that Tyr35 has little impact on the
  trypsin-bound BPTI structure and acts primarily to define the structure of the free
  protein so as to maximize binding affinity. o̧pyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
