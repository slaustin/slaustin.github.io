abstract: Allostery is largely associated with conformational and functional transitions
  in individual proteins. This concept can be extended to consider the impact of conformational
  perturbations on cellular function and disease states. Here, we clarify the concept
  of allostery and how it controls physiological activities. We focus on the challenging
  questions of how allostery can both cause disease and contribute to development
  of new therapeutics. We aim to increase the awareness of the linkage between disease
  symptoms on the cellular level and specific aberrant allosteric actions on the molecular
  level and to emphasize the potential of allosteric drugs in innovative therapies.
