abstract: The dynamics of hydrogen bonds among water molecules themselves and with
  the polar head groups (PHG) at a micellar surface have been investigated by long
  molecular dynamics simulations. The lifetime of the hydrogen bond between a PHG
  and a water molecule is found to be much longer than that between any two water
  molecules, and is likely to be a general feature of hydrophilic surfaces of organized
  assemblies. Analyses of individual water trajectories suggest that water molecules
  can remain bound to the micellar surface for more than 100 ps. The activation energy
  for such a transition from the bound to a free state for the water molecules is
  estimated to be about 3.5 kcal/mol.
