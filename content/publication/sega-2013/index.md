abstract: We present a generalized version of the ITIM algorithm for the identification
  of interfacial molecules, which is able to treat arbitrarily shaped interfaces.
  The algorithm exploits the similarities between the concept of probe sphere used
  in ITIM and the circumsphere criterion used in the $α$-shapes approach, and can
  be regarded either as a reference-frame independent version of the former, or as
  an extended version of the latter that includes the atomic excluded volume. The
  new algorithm is applied to compute the intrinsic orientational order parameters
  of water around a dodecylphosphocholine and a cholic acid micelle in aqueous environment,
  and to the identification of solvent-reachable sites in four model structures for
  soot. The additional algorithm introduced for the calculation of intrinsic density
  profiles in arbitrary geometries proved to be extremely useful also for planar interfaces,
  as it allows to solve the paradox of smeared intrinsic profiles far from the interface.
