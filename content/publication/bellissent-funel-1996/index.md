abstract: Water is essential for the stability and function of biological macromolecules.
  High-resolution quasi-elastic neutron scattering studies of the translational dynamics
  of water molecules on the surface of a deuteriated protein are presented. The quasi-elastic
  spectra from the interfacial H2O are analysed by a confined diffusion model to obtain
  the elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF), the short-time self-diffusion constant
  (D) and the residence time, $τ$o, as functions of coverage and temperature. The
  combined effects of the hydration level and temperature on the retardation of the
  single-particle motions are discussed in the light of available NMR relaxation data
  and of a well known model of $α$-relaxation from the theory of kinetic glass transitions
  in dense supercooled fluids. The vibrational density of states of interfacial water
  is presented as a function of temperature and for two levels of hydration of the
  protein.
