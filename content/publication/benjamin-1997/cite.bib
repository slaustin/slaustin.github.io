 abstract = {The structural, dynamical, and electrical properties of the interface between two immiscible liquids are described. The adsorption of solute molecules and the processes of ion transfer across the interface and of electron transfer at the interface are discussed. The microscopic perspective is emphasized by focusing on selected recent experimental results and on results obtained from molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo computer simulations. The validity of some of the existing models of the interface is examined. A proper account of the molecular structure of the interface is important for understanding solvation and charge transfer processes at the interface.},
