abstract: The structural, dynamical, and electrical properties of the interface between
  two immiscible liquids are described. The adsorption of solute molecules and the
  processes of ion transfer across the interface and of electron transfer at the interface
  are discussed. The microscopic perspective is emphasized by focusing on selected
  recent experimental results and on results obtained from molecular dynamics and
  Monte Carlo computer simulations. The validity of some of the existing models of
  the interface is examined. A proper account of the molecular structure of the interface
  is important for understanding solvation and charge transfer processes at the interface.
