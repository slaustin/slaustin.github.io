abstract: The last five years have witnessed major developments in the understanding
  of the allosteric phenomenon; broadly defined as coupling between remote molecular
  sites. Such advances have been driven not only by new theoretical models and pharmacological
  applications of allostery; but also by progress in the experimental approaches designed
  to map allosteric sites and transitions. Among these techniques; NMR spectroscopy
  has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity
  to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here; we highlight recent progress
  in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an
  overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant
  questions. The picture of the allosteric ``NMR toolbox'' is provided starting from
  one of the simplest models of allostery (i.e.; the four-state thermodynamic cycle)
  and continuing to more complex multistate mechanisms. We also review how such an
  ``NMR toolbox'' has assisted the elucidation of the allosteric molecular basis for
  disease-related mutations and the discovery of novel leads for allosteric drugs.
  From this overview; it is clear that NMR plays a central role not only in experimentally
  validating transformative theories of allostery; but also in tapping the full translational
  potential of allosteric systems.
