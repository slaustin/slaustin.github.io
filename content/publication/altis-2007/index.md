abstract: It has recently been suggested by Mu [Proteins 58, 45 (2005)] to use backbone
  dihedral angles instead of Cartesian coordinates in a principal component analysis
  of molecular dynamics simulations. Dihedral angles may be advantageous because internal
  coordinates naturally provide a correct separation of internal and overall motion,
  which was found to be essential for the construction and interpretation of the free
  energy landscape of a biomolecule undergoing large structural rearrangements. To
  account for the circular statistics of angular variables, a transformation from
  the space of dihedral angles  $Φ$n  to the metric coordinate space  xn =cos $Φ$n,
  yn =sin $Φ$n  was employed. To study the validity and the applicability of the approach,
  in this work the theoretical foundations underlying the dihedral angle principal
  component analysis (dPCA) are discussed. It is shown that the dPCA amounts to a
  one-to-one representation of the original angle distribution and that its principal
  components can readily be characterized by the corresponding conformational changes
  of the peptide. Furthermore, a complex version of the dPCA is introduced, in which
  N angular variables naturally lead to N eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Applying the
  methodology to the construction of the free energy landscape of decaalanine from
  a 300 ns molecular dynamics simulation, a critical comparison of the various methods
  is given. o̧pyright 2007 American Institute of Physics.
