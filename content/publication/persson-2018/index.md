abstract: o̧pyright 2018 Author(s). Much of biology happens at the protein-water interface,
  so all dynamical processes in this region are of fundamental importance. Local structural
  fluctuations in the hydration layer can be probed by17O magnetic relaxation dispersion
  (MRD), which, at high frequencies, measures the integral of a biaxial rotational
  time correlation function (TCF) - the integral rotational correlation time. Numerous17O
  MRD studies have demonstrated that this correlation time, when averaged over the
  first hydration shell, is longer than in bulk water by a factor 3-5. This rotational
  perturbation factor (RPF) has been corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations,
  which can also reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we address several
  outstanding problems in this area by analyzing an extensive set of molecular dynamics
  data, including four globular proteins and three water models. The vexed issue of
  polarity versus topography as the primary determinant of hydration water dynamics
  is resolved by establishing a protein-invariant exponential dependence of the RPF
  on a simple confinement index. We conclude that the previously observed correlation
  of the RPF with surface polarity is a secondary effect of the correlation between
  polarity and confinement. Water rotation interpolates between a perturbed but bulk-like
  collective mechanism at low confinement and an exchange-mediated orientational randomization
  (EMOR) mechanism at high confinement. The EMOR process, which accounts for about
  half of the RPF, was not recognized in previous simulation studies, where only the
  early part of the TCF was examined. Based on the analysis of the experimentally
  relevant TCF over its full time course, we compare simulated and measured RPFs,
  finding a 30% discrepancy attributable to force field imperfections. We also compute
  the full17O MRD profile, including the low-frequency dispersion produced by buried
  water molecules. Computing a local RPF for each hydration shell, we find that the
  perturbation decays exponentially with a decay \"length\" of 0.3 shells and that
  the second and higher shells account for a mere 3% of the total perturbation measured
  by17O MRD. The only long-range effect is a weak water alignment in the electric
  field produced by an electroneutral protein (not screened by counterions), but this
  effect is negligibly small for17O MRD. By contrast, we find that the17O TCF is significantly
  more sensitive to the important short-range perturbations than the other two TCFs
  examined here.
