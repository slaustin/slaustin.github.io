abstract: The computational study of conformational transitions in RNA and proteins
  with atomistic molecular dynamics often requires suitable enhanced sampling techniques.
  We here introduce a novel method where concurrent metadynamics are integrated in
  a Hamiltonian replica-exchange scheme. The ladder of replicas is built with different
  strengths of the bias potential exploiting the tunability of well-tempered metadynamics.
  Using this method, free-energy barriers of individual collective variables are significantly
  reduced compared with simple force-field scaling. The introduced methodology is
  flexible and allows adaptive bias potentials to be self-consistently constructed
  for a large number of simple collective variables, such as distances and dihedral
  angles. The method is tested on alanine dipeptide and applied to the difficult problem
  of conformational sampling in a tetranucleotide.
