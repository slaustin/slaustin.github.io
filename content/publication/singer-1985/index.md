abstract: It is shown that the free energies associated with the solutions of extended
  RISM integral equations can be obtained in closed form thus avoiding the necessity
  of numerical coupling parameter integrations. In addition, variational principles
  are deduced which provide a basis for efficient algorithms to solve extended RISM
  integral equations.
