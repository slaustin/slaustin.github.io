abstract: The cytokine hormone interleukin-2 (IL-2) contains a highly adaptive region
  that binds small, druglike molecules. The binding properties of this adaptive region
  have been explored using a \"tethering\" method that relies on the formation of
  a disulfide bond between the protein and small-molecule ligands. Using tethering,
  surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and X-ray crystallography, we have discovered that
  the IL-2 adaptive region contains at least two cooperative binding sites where the
  binding of a first ligand to one site promotes or antagonizes the binding of a second
  ligand to the second site. Cooperative energies of interaction of -2 kcal/mol are
  observed. The observation that the adaptive region contains two adjacent sites may
  lead to the development of tight-binding antagonists of a protein-protein interaction.
  Cooperative ligand binding in the adaptive region of IL-2 underscores the importance
  of protein dynamics in molecular recognition. The tethering approach provides a
  novel and general strategy for discovering such cooperative binding interactions
  in specific, flexible regions of protein structure.
