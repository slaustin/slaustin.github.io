abstract: Taxanes and other microtubule-stabilizing agents comprise an important class
  of anticancer drugs. It is well known that taxanes act by binding to $β$-tubulin
  on the lumenal side of microtubules. However, experimental evidence obtained in
  recent years led to the hypothesis of an external site on the microtubule wall to
  which taxanes and other microtubule-stabilizing agents could bind before being internalized
  to their lumenal site. In the present study, different computational techniques
  were combined to explore the possible existence of an exposed and easily accessible
  binding site for microtubule-stabilizing agents on the outside of microtubules.
  The results obtained indicate that the conformational rearrangement of the H6-H7
  hoop of $β$-tubulin can form a suitable pocket on the outer microtubule surface,
  and that paclitaxel can efficaciously interact with this newly-proposed binding
  site. o̧pyright 2009 FEBS.
