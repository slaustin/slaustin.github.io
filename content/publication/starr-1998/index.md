abstract: We study hydrogen-bond dynamics in liquid water at low temperatures using
  molecular dynamics simulations. We find that bond lifetime (``fast dynamics'') has
  Arrhenius temperature dependence. We also calculate the bond correlation function
  and find that the correlation time (``slow dynamics'') shows power-law behavior.
  This power-law behavior, as well as the decay of the bond correlations, is consistent
  with the predictions of the mode-coupling theory. The correlation time at the lowest
  temperature studied shows deviation from power-law behavior that suggests continuity
  of dynamic functions between the liquid and glassy states of water at low pressure.
