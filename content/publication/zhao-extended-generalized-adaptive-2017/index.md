abstract: Free-energy calculations in multiple dimensions constitute a challenging
  problem, owing to the significant computational cost incurred to achieve ergodic
  sampling. The generalized adaptive biasing force (gABF) algorithm calculates n one-dimensional
  lists of biasing forces to approximate the n-dimensional matrix by ignoring the
  coupling terms ordinarily taken into account in classical ABF simulations, thereby
  greatly accelerating sampling in the multidimensional space. This approximation
  may however occasionally lead to poor, incomplete exploration of the conformational
  space compared to classical ABF, especially when the selected coarse variables are
  strongly coupled. It has been found that introducing extended potentials coupled
  to the coarse variables of interest can virtually eliminate this shortcoming, and,
  thus, improve the efficiency of gABF simulations. In the present contribution, we
  propose a new free-energy method, coined extended generalized ABF (egABF), combining
  gABF with an extended Lagrangian strategy. The results for three illustrative examples
  indicate that (i) egABF can explore the transition coordinate much more efficiently
  compared with classical ABF, eABF, and gABF, in both simple and complex cases and
  (ii) egABF can achieve a higher accuracy than gABF, with a root mean-squared deviation
  between egABF and eABF free-energy profiles on the order of kBT. Furthermore, the
  new egABF algorithm outruns the previous ABF-based algorithms in high-dimensional
  free-energy calculations and, hence, represents a powerful importance-sampling alternative
  for the investigation of complex chemical and biological processes.
