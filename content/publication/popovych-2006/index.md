abstract: Allosteric interactions are typically considered to proceed through a series
  of discrete changes in bonding interactions that alter the protein conformation.
  Here we show that allostery can be mediated exclusively by transmitted changes in
  protein motions. We have characterized the negatively cooperative binding of cAMP
  to the dimeric catabolite activator protein (CAP) at discrete conformational states.
  Binding of the first cAMP to one subunit of a CAP dimer has no effect on the conformation
  of the other subunit. The dynamics of the system, however, are modulated in a distinct
  way by the sequential ligand binding process, with the first cAMP partially enhancing
  and the second cAMP completely quenching protein motions. As a result, the second
  cAMP binding incurs a pronounced conformational entropic penalty that is entirely
  responsible for the observed cooperativity. The results provide strong support for
  the existence of purely dynamics-driven allostery.
