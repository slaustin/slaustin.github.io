abstract: Molecular dynamics sampling can be enhanced via the promoting of potential
  energy fluctuations, for instance, based on a Hamiltonian modified with the addition
  of a potential-energy-dependent biasing term. To overcome the diffusion sampling
  issue, which reveals the fact that enlargement of event-irrelevant energy fluctuations
  may abolish sampling efficiency, the essential energy space random walk (EESRW)
  approach was proposed earlier. To more effectively accelerate the sampling of solute
  conformations in aqueous environment, in the current work, we generalized the EESRW
  method to a two-dimension-EESRW (2D-EESRW) strategy. Specifically, the essential
  internal energy component of a focused region and the essential interaction energy
  component between the focused region and the environmental region are employed to
  define the two-dimensional essential energy space. This proposal is motivated by
  the general observation that in different conformational events, the two essential
  energy components have distinctive interplays. Model studies on the alanine dipeptide
  and the aspartate-arginine peptide demonstrate sampling improvement over the original
  one-dimension-EESRW strategy; with the same biasing level, the present generalization
  allows more effective acceleration of the sampling of conformational transitions
  in aqueous solution. The 2D-EESRW generalization is readily extended to higher dimension
  schemes and employed in more advanced enhanced-sampling schemes, such as the recent
  orthogonal space random walk method.
