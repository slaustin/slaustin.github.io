abstract: Multimeric enzyme complexes are ubiquitous in nature and catalyze a broad
  range of useful biological transformations. They are often characterized by a tight
  allosteric coupling between subunits, making them highly inefficient when isolated.
  A good example is Tryptophan synthase (TrpS), an allosteric heterodimeric enzyme
  in the form of an $αββα$ complex that catalyzes the biosynthesis of Ltryptophan.
  In this study, we decipher the allosteric regulation existing in TrpS from Pyrococcus
  furiosus (Pf TrpS), and how the allosteric conformational ensemble is recovered
  in laboratory-evolved stand-alone $β$-subunit variants. We find that recovering
  the conformational ensemble of a subdomain of TrpS affecting the relative stabilities
  of open, partially closed, and closed conformations is a prerequisite for enhancing
  the catalytic efficiency of the $β$-subunit in the absence of its binding partner.
  The distal mutations resuscitate the allosterically driven conformational regulation
  and alter the populations and rates of exchange between these multiple conformational
  states, which are essential for the multistep reaction pathway of the enzyme. Interestingly,
  these distal mutations can be a priori predicted by careful analysis of the conformational
  ensemble of the TrpS enzyme through computational methods. Our study provides the
  enzyme design field with a rational approach for evolving allosteric enzymes toward
  improved stand-alone function for biosynthetic applications.
