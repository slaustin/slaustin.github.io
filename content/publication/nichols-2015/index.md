abstract: 'Ligand binding can change the pKa of protein residues and influence enzyme
  catalysis. Herein, we report three ultrahigh resolution X-ray crystal structures
  of CTX-M ?-lactamase, directly visualizing protonation state changes along the enzymatic
  pathway: apo protein at 0.79 Å, precovalent complex with nonelectrophilic ligand
  at 0.89 Å, and acylation transition state (TS) analogue at 0.84 Å. Binding of the
  noncovalent ligand induces a proton transfer from the catalytic Ser70 to the negatively
  charged Glu166, and the formation of a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) between
  Ser70 and Lys73, with a length of 2.53 Å and the shared hydrogen equidistant from
  the heteroatoms. QM/MM reaction path calculations determined the proton transfer
  barrier to be 1.53 kcal/mol. The LBHB is absent in the other two structures although
  Glu166 remains neutral in the covalent complex. Our data represents the first X-ray
  crystallographic example of a hydrogen engaged in an enzymatic LBHB, and demonstrates
  that desolvation of the active site by ligand binding can provide a protein microenvironment
  conducive to LBHB formation. It also suggests that LBHBs may contribute to stabilization
  of the TS in general acid/base catalysis together with other preorganized features
  of enzyme active sites. These structures reconcile previous experimental results
  suggesting alternatively Glu166 or Lys73 as the general base for acylation, and
  underline the importance of considering residue protonation state change when modeling
  protein?ligand interactions. Additionally, the observation of another LBHB (2.47
  Å) between two conserved residues, Asp233 and Asp246, suggests that LBHBs may potentially
  play a special structural role in proteins.'
