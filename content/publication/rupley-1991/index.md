abstract: Hydration can be considered a process of adding water incrementally to dry
  protein, until a level of hydration is reached beyond which further addition of
  water produces no change and only dilutes the protein. The hydration process has
  several stages and an end point, reflected similarly in different types of measurements.
  Time-average measurements appear to have a common pattern and most closely fit a
  single picture of the process. Dynamic measurements sometimes show a dependence
  on hydration level that lies outside the common pattern of the time-average results.
  The chapter summarizes the literature that bears on the protein hydration process
  and the hydration shell, categorized by type of measurement, and provides picture
  of the hydration process and the hydration shell and an assessment of the ways in
  which the hydration shell may modulate enzyme and other protein functions. The percolation
  model is discussed that focuses on the long-range connectivity established at a
  threshold coverage of a surface or volume with conducting or otherwise functional
  elements. oÌ§pyright 1991 Academic Press Inc.
