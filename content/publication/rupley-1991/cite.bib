 abstract = {Hydration can be considered a process of adding water incrementally to dry protein, until a level of hydration is reached beyond which further addition of water produces no change and only dilutes the protein. The hydration process has several stages and an end point, reflected similarly in different types of measurements. Time-average measurements appear to have a common pattern and most closely fit a single picture of the process. Dynamic measurements sometimes show a dependence on hydration level that lies outside the common pattern of the time-average results. The chapter summarizes the literature that bears on the protein hydration process and the hydration shell, categorized by type of measurement, and provides picture of the hydration process and the hydration shell and an assessment of the ways in which the hydration shell may modulate enzyme and other protein functions. The percolation model is discussed that focuses on the long-range connectivity established at a threshold coverage of a surface or volume with conducting or otherwise functional elements. oÌ§pyright 1991 Academic Press Inc.},
