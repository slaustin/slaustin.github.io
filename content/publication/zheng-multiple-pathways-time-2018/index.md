abstract: The open/close transition in adenylate kinase (AK) is regarded as a representative
  example for large-scale conformational transition in proteins, yet its mechanism
  remains unclear despite numerous experimental and computational studies. Using extensive
  ($∼$50 $μ$s) explicit solvent atomistic simulations and Markov state analysis, we
  shed new lights on the mechanism of this transition in the apo form of AK. The closed
  basin of apo AK features an open NMP domain while the LID domain closes and rotates
  toward it. Therefore, although the computed structural properties of the closed
  ensemble are consistent with previously reported FRET and PRE measurements, our
  simulations suggest that NMP closure is likely to follow AMP binding, in contrast
  to the previous interpretation of FRET and PRE data that the apo state was able
  to sample the fully closed conformation for ``ligand selection''. The closed state
  ensemble is found to be kinetically heterogeneous; multiple pathways and time scales
  are associated with the open/close transition, providing new clues to the disparate
  time scales observed in different experiments. Besides interdomain interactions,
  a novel mutual information analysis identifies specific intradomain interactions
  that correlate strongly to transition kinetics, supporting observations from previous
  chimera experiments. While our results underscore the role of internal domain properties
  in determining the kinetics of open/close transition in apo AK, no evidence is observed
  for any significant degree of local unfolding during the transition. These observations
  about AK have general implications to our view of conformational states, transition
  pathways, and time scales of conformational changes in proteins. The key features
  and time scales of observed transition pathways are robust and similar from simulations
  using two popular fixed charge force fields.
