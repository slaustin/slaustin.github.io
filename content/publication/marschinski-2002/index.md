abstract: Following the recently introduced concept of transfer entropy , we attempt
  to measure the information flow between two financial time series, the Dow Jones
  and DAX stock index. Being based on Shannon entropies, this model-free approach
  in principle allows us to detect statistical dependencies of all types, i.e. linear
  and nonlinear temporal correlations. However, when available data is limited and
  the expected effect is rather small, a straightforward implementation suffers badly
  from misestimation due to finite sample effects, making it basically impossible
  to assess the significance of the obtained values. We therefore introduce a modified
  estimator, called effective transfer entropy , which leads to improved results in
  such conditions. In the application, we then manage to confirm an information transfer
  on a time scale of one minute between the two financial time series. The different
  economic impact of the two indices is also recovered from the data. Numerical results
  are then interpreted on one hand as capability of one index to explain future observations
  of the other, and on the other hand within terms of coupling strengths in the framework
  of a bivariate autoregressive stochastic model. Evidence is given for a nonlinear
  character of the coupling between Dow Jones and DAX.
