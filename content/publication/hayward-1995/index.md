abstract: A comparison of a normal mode analysis and principal component analysis
  of a 200-ps molecular dynamics trajectory of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
  in vacuum has been made in order to further elucidate the harmonic and anharmonic
  aspects in the dynamics of proteins. An anharmonicity factor is defined which measures
  the degree of anharmonicity in the modes, be they principal modes or normal modes,
  and it is shown that the principal mode system naturally divides into anharmonic
  modes with peak frequencies below 80 cm-1, and harmonic modes with frequencies above
  this value. In general the larger the mean-square fluctuation of a principal mode,
  the greater the degree of anharmonicity in its motion. The anharmonic modes represent
  only 12% of the total number of variables, but account for 98% of the total mean-square
  fluctuation. The transitional nature of the anharmonic motion is demonstrated. The
  results strongly suggest that in a large subspace, the free energy surface, as probed
  by the simulation, is approximated by a multi-dimensional parabola which is just
  a rescaled version of the parabola corresponding to the harmonic approximation to
  the conformational energy surface at a single minimum. After 200 ps, the rescaling
  factor, termed the \"normal mode rescaling factor,\" has apparently converged to
  a value whereby the mean-square fluctuation within the subspace is about twice that
  predicted by the normal mode analysis.
