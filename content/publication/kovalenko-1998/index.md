abstract: We obtain three-dimensional density profiles of interaction sites of a molecular
  liquid in an external field by generalizing the solute-solvent equation of the reference
  interaction site model (RISM) at infinite dilution. The equation complemented with
  the analogue of the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure is solved on a three-dimensional
  grid by employing the dynamic relaxation technique. The distribution of water, represented
  by the simple point charge (SPC) model, around the central water molecule is obtained
  and discussed. The water density profiles near a (111) FCC crystalline surface are
  studied. The preferential location and orientation of adsorbed water molecules are
  discussed.
