abstract: What is the smallest protein? This is actually not such a simple question
  to answer, because there is no established consensus among scientists as to the
  definition of a protein. We describe here a designed molecule consisting of only
  10 amino acids. Despite its small size, its essential characteristics, revealed
  by its crystal structure, solution structure, thermal stability, free energy surface,
  and folding pathway network, are consistent with the properties of natural proteins.
  The existence of this kind of molecule deepens our understanding of proteins and
  impels us to define an ``ideal protein'' without inquiring whether the molecule
  actually occurs in nature.
