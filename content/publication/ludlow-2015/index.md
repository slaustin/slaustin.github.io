abstract: Proteins need to be tightly regulated as they control biological processes
  in most normal cellular functions. The precise mechanisms of regulation are rarely
  completely understood but can involve binding of endogenous ligands and/or partner
  proteins at specific locations on a protein that can modulate function. Often, these
  additional secondary binding sites appear separate to the primary binding site,
  which, for example for an enzyme, may bind a substrate. In previous work, we have
  uncovered several examples in which secondary binding sites were discovered on proteins
  using fragment screening approaches. In each case, we were able to establish that
  the newly identified secondary binding site was biologically relevant as it was
  able to modulate function by the binding of a small molecule. In this study, we
  investigate how often secondary binding sites are located on proteins by analyzing
  24 protein targets for which we have performed a fragment screen using X-ray crystallography.
  Our analysis shows that, surprisingly, the majority of proteins contain secondary
  binding sites based on their ability to bind fragments. Furthermore, sequence analysis
  of these previously unknown sites indicate high conservation, which suggests that
  they may have a biological function, perhaps via an allosteric mechanism. Comparing
  the physicochemical properties of the secondary sites with known primary ligand
  binding sites also shows broad similarities indicating that many of the secondary
  sites may be druggable in nature with small molecules that could provide new opportunities
  to modulate potential therapeutic targets.
