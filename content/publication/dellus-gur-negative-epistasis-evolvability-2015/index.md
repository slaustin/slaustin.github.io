abstract: Epistasis is a key factor in evolution since it determines which combinations
  of mutations provide adaptive solutions and which mutational pathways toward these
  solutions are accessible by natural selection. There is growing evidence for the
  pervasiveness of sign epistasis - a complete reversion of mutational effects, particularly
  in protein evolution - yet its molecular basis remains poorly understood. We describe
  the structural basis of sign epistasis between G238S and R164S, two adaptive mutations
  in TEM-1 $β$-lactamase - an enzyme that endows antibiotics resistance. Separated
  by 10 Å, these mutations initiate two separate trajectories toward increased hydrolysis
  rates and resistance toward second and third-generation cephalosporins antibiotics.
  Both mutations allow the enzyme's active site to adopt alternative conformations
  and accommodate the new antibiotics. By solving the corresponding set of crystal
  structures, we found that R164S causes local disorder whereas G238S induces discrete
  conformations. When combined, the mutations in 238 and 164 induce local disorder
  whereby nonproductive conformations that perturb the enzyme's catalytic preorganization
  dominate. Specifically, Asn170 that coordinates the deacylating water molecule is
  misaligned, in both the free form and the inhibitor-bound double mutant. This local
  disorder is not restored by stabilizing global suppressor mutations and thus leads
  to an evolutionary cul-de-sac. Conformational dynamism therefore underlines the
  reshaping potential of protein's structures and functions but also limits protein
  evolvability because of the fragility of the interactions networks that maintain
  protein structures.
