abstract: Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between caloric intake and
  energy expenditure, including expenditure from spontaneous physical activity (SPA).
  Changes in SPA and resulting changes in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)
  likely interact with diet to influence risk for obesity. However, previous research
  on the relationship between diet, physical activity, and energy expenditure has
  been mixed. The neuropeptide orexin is a driver of SPA, and orexin neuron activity
  can be manipulated using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer
  Drugs). We hypothesized that HFD decreases SPA and NEAT, and that DREADD-mediated
  activation of orexin neuron signaling would abolish this decrease and produce an
  increase in NEAT instead. To test these ideas, we characterized behaviors to determine
  the extent to which access to a high-fat diet (HFD) influences the proportion and
  probability of engaging in food intake and activity. We then measured NEAT following
  access to HFD and following a DREADD intervention targeting orexin neurons. Two
  cohorts of orexin-cre male mice were injected with an excitatory DREADD virus into
  the caudal hypothalamus, where orexin neurons are concentrated. Mice were then housed
  in continuous metabolic phenotyping cages (Sable Promethion). Food intake, indirect
  calorimetry, and SPA were automatically measured every second. For cohort 1 (n =
  8), animals were given access to chow, then switched to HFD. For cohort 2 (n = 4/group),
  half of the animals were given access to HFD, the other access to chow. Then, among
  animals on HFD, orexin neurons were activated following injections of clozapine
  n-oxide (CNO). Mice on HFD spent significantly less time eating (p $<$ 0.01) and
  more time inactive compared to mice on chow (p $<$ 0.01). Following a meal, mice
  on HFD were significantly more likely to engage in periods of inactivity compared
  to those on chow (p $<$ 0.05). NEAT was decreased in animals on HFD, and was increased
  to the NEAT level of control animals following activation of orexin neurons with
  DREADDs. Food intake (kilocalories) was not significantly different between mice
  on chow and HFD, yet mice on chow expended more energy per unit of SPA, relative
  to that in mice consuming HFD. These results suggest that HFD consumption reduces
  SPA and NEAT, and increases inactivity following a meal. Together, the data suggest
  a change in the efficiency of energy expenditure based upon diet, such that SPA
  during HFD burns fewer calories compared to SPA on a standard chow diet.
