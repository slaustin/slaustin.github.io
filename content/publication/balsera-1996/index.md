abstract: It has been suggested that principal component analysis can identify slow
  modes in proteins and, thereby, facilitate the study of long time dynamics. However,
  sampling errors due to finite simulation times preclude the identification of slow
  modes that can be used for this purpose. This is demonstrated numerically with the
  aid of simulations of the protein G-actin and analytically with the aid of a model
  which is exactly recoverable by principal component analysis. Although principal
  component analysis usually demonstrates that a set of a small number of modes captures
  the majority of the fluctuations, the set depends on the particular sampling time
  window and its width.
