abstract: The properties of water in biological systems have been studied for well
  over a century by a wide range of physical techniques, but progress has been slow
  and erratic. Protein hydration - the perturbation of water structure and dynamics
  by the protein surface - has been a particularly rich source of controversy and
  confusion. Our aim here is to critically examine central concepts in the description
  of protein hydration, and to assess the experimental basis for the current view
  of protein hydration, with the focus on dynamic aspects. Recent oxygen-17 magnetic
  relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments have shown that the vast majority of water
  molecules in the protein hydration layer suffer a mere twofold dynamic retardation
  compared with bulk water. The high mobility of hydration water ensures that all
  thermally activated processes at the protein-water interface, such as binding, recognition
  and catalysis, can proceed at high rates. The MRD-derived picture of a highly mobile
  hydration layer is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but is
  incompatible with results deduced from intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect
  spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is also inconsistent
  with the common view of hydration effects on protein hydrodynamics. Here, we show
  how these discrepancies can be resolved.
