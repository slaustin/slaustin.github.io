abstract: A new method for performing molecular dynamics simulations under constant
  pressure is presented. In the method, which is based on the extended system formalism
  introduced by Andersen, the deterministic equations of motion for the piston degree
  of freedom are replaced by a Langevin equation; a suitable choice of collision frequency
  then eliminates the unphysical \"ringing\" of the volume associated with the piston
  mass. In this way it is similar to the \"weak coupling algorithm\" developed by
  Berendsen and co-workers to perform molecular dynamics simulation without piston
  mass effects. It is shown, however, that the weak coupling algorithm induces artifacts
  into the simulation which can be quite severe for inhomogeneous systems such as
  aqueous biopolymers or liquid/liquid interfaces.
