abstract: Proteins exist as conformational ensembles composed of multiple interchanging
  substates separated by kinetic barriers. Interconverting conformations are often
  difficult to probe, owing to their sparse population and transient nature. Here,
  we report the identification and characterization of a subset of conformations in
  ubiquitin that participate in microsecond-to- millisecond motions in the amides
  of Ile23, Asn25, and Thr55. A novel side chain to the backbone hydrogen bond that
  regulates these motions has also been identified. Combining our NMR studies with
  the available X-ray data, we have unearthed the physical process underlying slow
  motions-the interconversion of a type I into a type II $β$-turn flip at residues
  Glu51 through Arg54. Interestingly, the dominant conformer of wild-type ubiquitin
  observed in solution near neutral pH is only represented by about 22% of the crystal
  structures. The conformers generated as a result of the dynamics of the hydrogen
  bond appear to be correlated to ligand recognition by ubiquitin. o̧pyright 2011
