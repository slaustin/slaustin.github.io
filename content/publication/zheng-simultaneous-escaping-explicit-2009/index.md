abstract: To overcome the pseudoergodicity problem, conformational sampling can be
  accelerated via generalized ensemble methods, e.g., through the realization of random
  walks along prechosen collective variables, such as spatial order parameters, energy
  scaling parameters, or even system temperatures or pressures, etc. As usually observed,
  in generalized ensemble simulations, hidden barriers are likely to exist in the
  space perpendicular to the collective variable direction and these residual free
  energy barriers could greatly abolish the sampling efficiency. This sampling issue
  is particularly severe when the collective variable is defined in a low-dimension
  subset of the target system; then the ``Hamiltonian lagging'' problem, which reveals
  the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the move of the collective
  variable, may be likely to occur. To overcome this problem in equilibrium conformational
  sampling, we adopted the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) strategy, which was
  originally developed in the context of free energy simulation [L. Zheng, M. Chen,
  and W. Yang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.â€ˆ105, 20227 (2008)]. Thereby, generalized
  ensemble simulations can simultaneously escape both the explicit barriers along
  the collective variable direction and the hidden barriers that are strongly coupled
  with the collective variable move. As demonstrated in our model studies, the present
  OSRW based generalized ensemble treatments show improved sampling capability over
  the corresponding classical generalized ensemble treatments.
