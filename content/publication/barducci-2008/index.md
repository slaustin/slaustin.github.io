abstract: We present a method for determining the free-energy dependence on a selected
  number of collective variables using an adaptive bias. The formalism provides a
  unified description which has metadynamics and canonical sampling as limiting cases.
  Convergence and errors can be rigorously and easily controlled. The parameters of
  the simulation can be tuned so as to focus the computational effort only on the
  physically relevant regions of the order parameter space. The algorithm is tested
  on the reconstruction of an alanine dipeptide free-energy landscape. oÌ§pyright 2008
