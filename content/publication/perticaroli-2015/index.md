abstract: Extended frequency range depolarized light scattering is a spectroscopic
  technique operating in the GHz-THz range that, applied to aqueous solutions of biomolecules,
  is able to disentangle the dynamics of the solute from that of water, and relaxation
  processes of bulk from those of hydration water. Experiments performed on aqueous
  solution of a variety of biological systems of different nature, such as small hydrophobic
  and hydrophilic molecules, amino acids, dipeptides, and proteins, have shown that
  a significant increase in the dynamical retardation and in the extent of the perturbation
  of water surrounding solute molecules occurs at increasing chemical complexity of
  the solute. The behavior of aqueous solutions of lysozyme is here analyzed in detail,
  as a function of solute concentration. Our results provide evidence of a dynamical
  perturbation extending over more than three water layers in diluted solutions. We
  find a strong reduction in the average hydration number at increasing solute concentration
  that cannot be explained by the random superposition of hydration layers among lysozyme
  molecules in close proximity. This behavior is consistent with the formation of
  clusters in solution.
