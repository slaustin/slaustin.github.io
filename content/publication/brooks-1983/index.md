abstract: A normal mode analysis making use of an empirical potential function including
  local and nonlocal (nonbonded) interactions is performed for the bovine pancreatic
  trypsin inhibitor in the full conformational space of the molecule (1,740 degrees
  of freedom); that is, all bond lengths and angles, as well as dihedral angles, are
  included for the 580-atom system consisting of all heavy atoms and polar hydrogens.
  The heavy-atom frequency spectrum shows a dense distribution between 3 and 1,800
  cm-1, with 350 modes below 216 cm-1. Most of the low-frequency modes, of which many
  have significant anharmonic character, are found to be delocalized over the protein.
  The root-mean-square amplitudes of the atomic fluctuations are calculated at 300
  K from the normal modes and compared with those obtained from a solution molecular
  dynamics simulation based on the same potential function; very good agreement is
  obtained for the variation in the main-chain fluctuations as a function of residue
  number, though larger differences occur for the side chains. The fluctuations are
  generally, though not always, dominated by frequencies below 30 cm-1, in accord
  with the results of the dynamics simulation. The vibrational contributions to the
  thermodynamic properties of the protein are calculated as a function of temperature;
  the effects of perturbations on the spectrum, suggested for ligand or substrate
  binding, are examined. The analysis demonstrates that, in spite of the anharmonic
  contributions to the potential, a normal mode description can provide useful results
  concerning the internal motions of proteins.
