abstract: 'In this report, we describe a truncated Deinococcus radiodurans 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase (DXS) protein that retains enzymatic activity, while slowing protein degradation
  and showing improved crystallization properties. With modern drug-design approaches
  relying heavily on the elucidation of atomic interactions of potential new drugs
  with their targets, the need for co-crystal structures with the compounds of interest
  is high. DXS itself is a promising drug target, as it catalyzes the first reaction
  in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)-pathway for the biosynthesis of
  the universal precursors of terpenes, which are essential secondary metabolites.
  In contrast to many bacteria and pathogens, which employ the MEP pathway, mammals
  use the distinct mevalonate-pathway for the biosynthesis of these precursors, which
  makes all enzymes of the MEP-pathway potential new targets for the development of
  anti-infectives. However, crystallization of DXS has proven to be challenging: while
  the first X-ray structures from Escherichia coli and D. radiodurans were solved
  in 2004, since then only two additions have been made in 2019 that were obtained
  under anoxic conditions. The presented site of truncation can potentially also be
  transferred to other homologues, opening up the possibility for the determination
  of crystal structures from pathogenic species, which until now could not be crystallized.
  This manuscript also provides a further example that truncation of a variable region
  of a protein can lead to improved structural data.'
