abstract: 'Background: Binding sites are the pockets of proteins that can bind drugs;
  the discovery of these pockets is a critical step in drug design. With the help
  of computers, protein pockets prediction can save manpower and financial resources.
  Results: In this paper, a novel protein descriptor for the prediction of binding
  sites is proposed. Information on non-bonded interactions in the three-dimensional
  structure of a protein is captured by a combination of geometry-based and energy-based
  methods. Moreover, due to the rapid development of deep learning, all binding features
  are extracted to generate three-dimensional grids that are fed into a convolution
  neural network. Two datasets were introduced into the experiment. The sc-PDB dataset
  was used for descriptor extraction and binding site prediction, and the PDBbind
  dataset was used only for testing and verification of the generalization of the
  method. The comparison with previous methods shows that the proposed descriptor
  is effective in predicting the binding sites. Conclusions: A new protein descriptor
  is proposed for the prediction of the drug binding sites of proteins. This method
  combines the three-dimensional structure of a protein and non-bonded interactions
  with small molecules to involve important factors influencing the formation of binding
  site. Analysis of the experiments indicates that the descriptor is robust for site
  prediction.'
