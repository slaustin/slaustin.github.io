abstract: Notable recent developments in the use of normal mode methods to study protein
  dynamics include the use of quasiharmonic descriptions in crystallographic and NMR
  refinement protocols, and the development of techniques that can be applied to disordered
  systems (such as liquids) that do not oscillate about a single minimum. Harmonic
  models can also be used to investigate quantum effects and to provide a compact
  description of correlated motions in biomolecules. This sort of analysis has both
  prospects and limitations. oÌ§pyright 1994.
