abstract: The structure of adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli ligated with the
  two-substratemimicking inhibitor P1,P5-bis(adenosine-5$prime$-)pentaphosphate has
  been determined by X-ray diffraction and refined to a resolution of 1$·$9 Å. The
  asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two copies of the complex, the structures
  of which agree well with each other. One of these copies is less well ordered in
  the crystals than the other, it shows generally higher temperature factors. The
  molecular packing in the crystals is discussed and correlated to crystal habit and
  anisotropic X-ray diffraction. The bound inhibitor simulates well the binding of
  substrates ATP and AMP, which are clearly assigned. The $α$-phosphate of AMP is
  well positioned for a nucleophilic attack on the $γ$-phosphate of ATP. The observed
  structure readily allows the construction of a stabilized pentaco-ordinated transition
  state, as proposed for the known in-line mechanism of the enzyme, with nucleophile
  and leaving group in the apical positions of a trigonal bipyramid. The kinetic data
  of numerous mutations reported in the literature are correlated with the detailed
  structure of the enzyme. The mutants were classified. The concomitant increase of
  the Michaelis constants for ATP and AMP in the group of mutants that modify only
  the ATP-binding site cannot be explained.
