abstract: The CAPRI Challenge is a blind test of protein-protein-docking algorithms
  that predict the complex structure from the crystal structures of the interacting
  proteins. We participated in both rounds of this blind test and submitted predictions
  for all seven targets, relying mainly on our Fast Fourier Transform based algorithm
  ZDOCK that combines shape complementarity, desolvation, and electrostatics. Our
  group made good predictions for three targets and had at least some success with
  three others. Implications of the treatment of prior biological information as well
  as contributions of manual inspection to docking predictions are also discussed.
