abstract: "Water plays a unique role in all living organisms. Not only is it nature's
  ubiquitous solvent, but it also actively takes part in many cellular processes.
  In particular, the structure and properties of interfacial water near biomolecules
  such as proteins are often related to the function of the respective molecule. It
  can therefore be highly instructive to study the local water density around solutes
  in cellular systems, particularly when solvent-mediated forces such as the hydrophobic
  effect are relevant. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
  seem well suited to study these systems at the atomic level. However, due to sampling
  requirements, it is not clear that MD simulations are, indeed, the method of choice
  to obtain converged densities at a given level of precision. We here compare the
  calculation of local water densities with two different methods: MD simulations
  and the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata
  closure (3D-RISM-KH). In particular, we investigate the convergence of the local
  water density to assess the required simulation times for different levels of resolution.
  Moreover, we provide a quantitative comparison of the densities calculated with
  MD and with 3D-RISM-KH and investigate the effect of the choice of the water model
  for both methods. Our results show that 3D-RISM-KH yields density distributions
  that are very similar to those from MD up to a 0.5 Ã… resolution, but for significantly
  reduced computational cost. The combined use of MD and 3D-RISM-KH emerges as an
  auspicious perspective for efficient solvent sampling in dynamical systems."
