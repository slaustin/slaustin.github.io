abstract: "Employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study the formation of
  novel protein cryptic sites has attracted increasing interest in the field of drug
  discovery. One specific challenge in this area is finding a viable method to accurately
  identify and characterize cryptic site transitions from MD simulation results while
  minimizing the need for extensive human input. Since the formation of cryptic sites
  often involves significant conformational changes in the protein structure, a method
  capable of capturing and describing these dynamic pocket transitions with precision
  is essential. In this paper, we present a new procedure, Conformational Dynamics
  Capturing and Water-Based Characterization (CDC-WBC). This procedure dynamically
  identifies the cryptic site region by tracking protein conformational changes observed
  during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The procedure also incorporates water
  density information to enhance the characterization of cryptic sites across frames.
  We evaluate the CDC-WBC procedure by applying it to characterize the opening process
  of the two well-studied cryptic sites in TEM1 $β$-lactamase. The results demonstrate
  that the CDC-WBC method accurately captures the open-closed transitions of the two
  cryptic sites. For comparison, three commonly used protein cavity detection methods
  in cryptic sites studies, POVME2, Epock, and MDpocket, are applied to identify the
  ``CBT'' cryptic site in TEM1 $β$-lactamase. The results show that the CDC-WBC method
  outperforms these methods in characterizing the transitions of the ``CBT'' cryptic
  site. Additionally, using a benchmark set of 84 protein systems (93 cryptic pockets)
  from the CryptoSite data set, CDC-WBC consistently shows better performance in distinguishing
  between the open and closed states of cryptic sites, further highlighting its capability
  for precise characterization of dynamic cryptic site transitions. The detailed implementation
  of the CDC-WBC procedure and demo data sets are uploaded to GitHub: https://github.com/TianmingQu/CDC-WBC.git"
