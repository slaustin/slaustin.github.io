abstract: The tertiary structure of a protein indicates what vital function that protein
  fulfills in the cell. Prediction of the metal binding comformation of a protein
  from its sequence is a crucial step in predicting its tertiary structure. In this
  study, a computational method was developed for predicting the binding of Histidine
  and Cysteine to metals. We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture,
  DeepMBS, to predict protein metal binding sites. To our knowledge, this study is
  the first realization of deep learning idea for the problem of predicting metal
  binding site. The method allows automatic extraction of complex interactions between
  important features using only sequence information by utilizing PAM120 scoring matrix.
  Features were extracted from protein sequences obtained from the Protein Data Bank
  and deep convolutional neural network was applied to these features. According to
  experimental results on a benchmark dataset, metal binding states can be predicted
  with 82% recall and 79% precision. These results show that a better performance
  can be achived with deep learning approach compared with previous studies on the
  same dataset.
