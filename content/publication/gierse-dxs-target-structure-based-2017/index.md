abstract: In this review, we analyze the enzyme DXS, the first and rate-limiting protein
  in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway. This pathway was discovered in 1996
  and is one of two known metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of the universal
  building blocks for isoprenoids. It promises to offer new targets for the development
  of anti-infectives against the human pathogens, malaria or tuberculosis. We mapped
  the sequence conservation of 1-deoxy-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase on the protein
  structure and analyzed it in comparison with previously identified druggable pockets.
  We provide a recent overview of known inhibitors of the enzyme. Taken together,
  this sets the stage for future structure-based drug design.
