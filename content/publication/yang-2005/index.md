abstract: Growing evidence supports the view that enzymatic activity results from
  a subtle interplay between chemical kinetics and molecular motions. A systematic
  analysis is performed here to delineate the type and level of coupling between catalysis
  and conformational mechanics. The dynamics of a set of 98 enzymes representative
  of different EC classes are analyzed with the Gaussian network model (GNM) and compared
  with experimental data. In more than 70% of the examined enzymes, the global hinge
  centers predicted by the GNM are found to be colocalized with the catalytic sites
  experimentally identified. Low translational mobility ($<$7%) is observed for the
  catalytic residues, consistent with the fine-tuned design of enzymes to achieve
  precise mechanochemical activities. Ligand binding sites, while closely neighboring
  catalytic sites, enjoy a moderate flexibility to accommodate the ligand binding.
  These findings could serve as additionalcriteria for assessing drug binding residues
  and could lessen the computational burden of substrate docking searches. oÌ§pyright2005
