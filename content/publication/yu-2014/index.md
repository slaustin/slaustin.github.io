abstract: Database screening using receptor-based pharmacophores is a computer-aided
  drug design technique that uses the structure of the target molecule (i.e. protein)
  to identify novel ligands that may bind to the target. Typically receptor-based
  pharmacophore modeling methods only consider a single or limited number of receptor
  conformations and map out the favorable binding patterns in vacuum or with a limited
  representation of the aqueous solvent environment, such that they may suffer from
  neglect of protein flexibility and desolvation effects. Site-Identification by Ligand
  Competitive Saturation (SILCS) is an approach that takes into account these, as
  well as other, properties to determine 3-dimensional maps of the functional group-binding
  patterns on a target receptor (i.e. FragMaps). In this study, a method to use the
  FragMaps to automatically generate receptor-based pharmacophore models is presented.
  It converts the FragMaps into SILCS pharmacophore features including aromatic, aliphatic,
  hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor chemical functionalities. The method generates
  multiple pharmacophore hypotheses that are then quantitatively ranked using SILCS
  grid free energies. The pharmacophore model generation protocol is validated using
  three different protein targets, including using the resulting models in virtual
  screening. Improved performance and efficiency of the SILCS derived pharmacophore
  models as compared to published docking studies, as well as a recently developed
  receptor-based pharmacophore modeling method is shown, indicating the potential
  utility of the approach in rational drug design. oÌ§pyright 2014 Springer International
