abstract: Somatic mutations in the small GTPase K-Ras are the most common activating
  lesions found in human cancer, and are generally associated with poor response to
  standard therapies. Efforts to target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties
  owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known allosteric
  regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional activation of Ras family
  proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by GTPase activity,
  the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative nucleotide affinity
  and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP and increases the proportion
  of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules that
  irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely
  on the mutant cysteine for binding and therefore do not affect the wild-type protein.
  Crystallographic studies reveal the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent
  in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Binding
  of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting
  the native nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing binding to
  Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory
  site on Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner. oÌ§pyright 2013 Macmillan
