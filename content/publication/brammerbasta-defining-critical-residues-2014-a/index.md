abstract: 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase catalyzes the formation of
  DXP from pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GraP) in a thiamin diphosphate-dependent
  manner, and is the first step in the essential pathway to isoprenoids in human pathogens.
  Understanding the mechanism of this unique enzyme is critical for developing new
  anti-infective agents that selectively target isoprenoid biosynthesis. The present
  study used mutagenesis and a combination of protein fluorescence, CD and kinetics
  experiments to investigate the roles of Arg420, Arg478 and Tyr392 in substrate binding
  and catalysis. The results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism,
  and predict that Arg420 and Arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate,
  GraP. d-Glyceraldehyde, an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl
  group predicted to interact with Arg420 and Arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation
  of the predecarboxylation intermediate C2$Î±$-lactylthiamin diphosphate (LThDP) on
  DXP synthase, indicating that this binding interaction is not absolutely required,
  and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation. Unexpectedly,
  Tyr392 contributes to GraP affinity, and is not required for LThDP formation or
  its GraP-promoted decarboxylation. Time-resolved CD spectroscopy and NMR experiments
  indicate that LThDP is significantly stabilized on R420A and Y392F variants as compared
  with wild-type DXP synthase in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions
  do not appear to affect the rate of GraP-promoted LThDP decarboxylation in the presence
  of high levels of GraP, and LThDP formation remains the rate-limiting step. These
  results suggest a role of these residues in promoting GraP binding, which in turn
  facilitates decarboxylation, and also highlight interesting differences between
  DXP synthase and other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes.
