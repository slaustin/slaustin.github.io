abstract: The dynamics ol a folded globular protein (bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor)
  have been studied by so!J.ing the equations of motion for the atoms with an empirical
  potential energy function. The results provide the magnitude, correlations and decay
  of fluctuations about the average structure. These suggest that the protein interior
  is fluid-like in that the local atom motions ha1$∙$e a difji1sional character. RESULTS
  of X-ray crystallography provide a picture of a globular protein in its native conformation
  as a well defined, densely-packed structure. Other experimental data 1-to and theoretical
  considerations\"-'\" indicate that there is considerable local motion inside a protein
  at ordinary temperatures. Moreover, the structural data themselves show that significant
  residue or subunit displacements have an important role in the activity of proteins
  (for example, enzyme catalysis' haemo-globin cooperativity 15 , immunoglobulin action
  16). To obtain a more complete understanding of proteins, it is essential to have
  a detailed knowledge of their dynamics. In spite of the considerable effort directed
  toward protein folding 17 , very little has been done to investigate the motions
  of a protein in the neighbourhood of its equilibrium configuration. For certain
  cases in which the displacements along a suitably chosen coordinate can be isolated
  (for example, aromatic side chain rotations in the pancreatic trypsin inhibitor'\",
  the opening and closing of the active site cleft in lysozyme 12), it has been demonstrated
  that empirical energy functions can be used to analyse the motion involved. Here
  we undertake a more general examination of the internal dynamics of a folded globular
  protein. The approach used is of the molecular dynamics type'\". ln such a study
  the classical equations of motion for all the atoms of an assembly are solved simultaneously
  for a suitable time period and detailed information is extracted by analysing the
  resulting atomic trajectories. The full interatomic potential can be used to obtain
  the forces on the atoms, so that the method is applicable even when the system is
  highly anhar-monic. The molecular dynamics approach has been very successful in
  revealing structural and dynamical characteristics of fluids\"' $·$ As we demonstrate
  in what follows, molecular dynamics can have a corresponding role for the internal
  motions of proteins. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PTI) (see Fig. Ia) was
  selected for study because of its small size (58 amino acid residues), high stability
  and accurately determined X-ray structure\"\"$·$\"'$·$ Four water molecules, which
  are strongly bound in the interior, were included in the dynamical simulation. The
  potentia l energy was represented by an empirical function' \" composed of a sum
  of terms associated with bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds,
  and non-bonded (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions. Hydrogen atoms are
  not explicitly considered, but are combined with the heavy atoms to which they are
  bonded by a suitable adjustment of atomic parameters. This use of 'extended atoms'
  reduces the number of interactions which must be calculated and also permits larger
  steps in the trajectory calculation since the high frequency hydrogen vibrations
  have been eliminated. Integration of the equations of motion was performed by means
  of the Gear algorithm 22 with time steps of 9.78 X w-IS s. X-ray coordinates 21
  were used for the initial positions and the initial velocities were set equal to
  zero. After 100 equilibration steps, the stresses in the if)itial structure had
  partly relaxed and the system had an internal kinetic energy corresponding to a
  temperature of 140 K. At this point, all velocities were multiplied by a factor
  of 1.5 and 250 more equilibration steps were taken. The added kinetic energy (250.6
  kcal moJ-1) partitioned itself between kinetic and potential terms during this interval,
  and an average kinetic temperature of 285 K was reached. The actual simulation consisted
  of 9,000 additional steps, corresponding to 8.8 ps. Some equilibration of the bond
  lengths, bond angles and electrostatic interactions continues during the first 3
  ps of the simulation, producing a small rise in temperature. Over the whole simulation,
  the average temperature is 295 K and the total energy is well conserved, changing
  by only 0. 7 kcal mol-$·$ 1 $∙$ ln what follows we first describe results concerned
  with the relation between the time-averaged and X-ray structures and with the magnitudes
  of structural fluctuations. We then examine the details of the dynamics, the correlation
  and damping of fluctuations, and some examples of the larger changes that occur.
  Of primary importance are the conclusions reached concerning the fluid-like nature
  of the internal motions, which will clearly have to be considered in developing
  dynamical models for biological processes. Time-averaged structure and fluctuations
  The time-averaged structure obtained in the dynamics run is near the X-ray structure
  but not identical with it; the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of the a carbons
  is 1.2 A and that for all the atoms is 1. 7 A. The largest deviations come from
  the two ends of the molecule, the external loop (residues 25-28) and exposed sidechains.
  The two parts of the 13 sheet (residues 18-24, 29-35) and the a helix (residues
  47-56) have significantly smaller deviations. Use of the X-ray structure as the
  starting configuration corresponds to 0.4 kcal mol-1 of kinetic energy per atom
  after equilibration (140 K); for the main dynamics run (295 K), the mean kinetic
  energy per atom is about 0.9 kcal mol-1 $∙$ Although there is no tendency to unfold,
  the dynamic development with this kinetic energy permits the molecule to make small
  rearrangements throughout; a picture of the structure after 3.2 ps is shown in Fig.
  lb. Apparently the PTL molecule samples a series of neighbouring conformations,
  the average of which is not identical with the X-ray structure. It is not clear
  how much of the difference is a real effect (in the sense that the structure in
  the crystal is constrained) and how much is due to inaccuracies in the potential
  function and the absence of solvent. In lysozyme, comparison of the X-ray structures
  for the triclinic and tetragonal crystal forms 23 ' 24 shows an r.m.s.
