abstract: CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile
  and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last
  three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including
  proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands,
  as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of
  such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include
  numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular
  minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities.
  The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle
  systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy
  functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields,
  to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various
  boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been
  ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article
  provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments
  since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.
