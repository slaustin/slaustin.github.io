 abstract = {The misfolding of intrinsically disordered proteins such as $α$-synuclein, tau and the A$β$ peptide has been associated with many highly debilitating neurodegenerative syndromes including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Therapeutic targeting of the monomeric state of such intrinsically disordered proteins by small molecules has, however, been a major challenge because of their heterogeneous conformational properties. We show here that a combination of computational and experimental techniques has led to the identification of a drug-like phenyl-sulfonamide compound (ELN484228), that targets $α$-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease. We found that this compound has substantial biological activity in cellular models of $α$-synuclein-mediated dysfunction, including rescue of $α$-synuclein- induced disruption of vesicle trafficking and dopaminergic neuronal loss and neurite retraction most likely by reducing the amount of $α$-synuclein targeted to sites of vesicle mobilization such as the synapse in neurons or the site of bead engulfment in microglial cells. These results indicate that targeting $α$-synuclein by small molecules represents a promising approach to the development of therapeutic treatments of Parkinson's disease and related conditions. o̧pyright 2014 Tóth et al.},
