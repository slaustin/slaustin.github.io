abstract: The misfolding of intrinsically disordered proteins such as $α$-synuclein,
  tau and the A$β$ peptide has been associated with many highly debilitating neurodegenerative
  syndromes including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Therapeutic targeting
  of the monomeric state of such intrinsically disordered proteins by small molecules
  has, however, been a major challenge because of their heterogeneous conformational
  properties. We show here that a combination of computational and experimental techniques
  has led to the identification of a drug-like phenyl-sulfonamide compound (ELN484228),
  that targets $α$-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease. We found that
  this compound has substantial biological activity in cellular models of $α$-synuclein-mediated
  dysfunction, including rescue of $α$-synuclein- induced disruption of vesicle trafficking
  and dopaminergic neuronal loss and neurite retraction most likely by reducing the
  amount of $α$-synuclein targeted to sites of vesicle mobilization such as the synapse
  in neurons or the site of bead engulfment in microglial cells. These results indicate
  that targeting $α$-synuclein by small molecules represents a promising approach
  to the development of therapeutic treatments of Parkinson's disease and related
  conditions. o̧pyright 2014 Tóth et al.
