abstract: An ad-hoc, yet widely adopted approach to investigate complex molecular
  objects in motion using importance-sampling schemes involves two steps, namely (i)
  mapping the multidimensional free-energy landscape that characterizes the movements
  in the molecular object at hand and (ii) finding the most probable transition path
  connecting basins of the free-energy hyperplane. To achieve this goal, we turn to
  an importance-sampling algorithm, coined well-tempered metadynamicsextended adaptive
  biasing force (WTM-eABF), aimed at mapping rugged free-energy landscapes, combined
  with a path-searching algorithm, which we call multidimensional lowest energy (MULE),
  to identify the underlying minimum free-energy pathway in the collective-variable
  space of interest. First, the well-tempered feature of the importancesampling scheme
  confers to the latter an asymptotic convergence, while the overall algorithm inherits
  the advantage of high sampling efficiency of its predecessor, metaeABF, making its
  performance less sensitive to user-defined parameters. Second, the Dijkstra algorithm
  implemented in MULE is able to identify with utmost efficiency a pathway that satisfies
  minimum free energy of activation among all the possible routes in the multidimensional
  free-energy landscape. Numerical simulations of three molecular assemblies indicate
  that association of WTM-eABF and MULE constitutes a reliable, efficient and robust
  approach for exploring coupled movements in complex molecular objects. On account
  of its ease of use and intrinsic performance, we expect WTM-eABF and MULE to become
  a tool of choice for both experts and nonexperts interested in the thermodynamics
  and the kinetics of processes relevant to chemistry and biology.
