abstract: Using recent advances in the Random First-Order Transition (RFOT) Theory
  of glass-forming liquids, we explain how the molecular motions of a glass-forming
  solvent distort the protein's boundary and slave some of the protein's conformational
  motions. Both the length and time scales of the solvent imposed constraints are
  provided by the RFOT theory. Comparison of the protein relaxation rate to that of
  the solvent provides an explicit lower bound on the size of the conformational space
  explored by the protein relaxation. Experimental measurements of slaving of myoglobin
  motions indicate that a major fraction of functionally important motions have significant
  entropic barriers.
