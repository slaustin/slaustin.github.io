 abstract = {Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AdK) is a small, monomeric enzyme that synchronizes the catalytic step with the enzyme's conformational dynamics to optimize a phosphoryl transfer reaction and the subsequent release of the product. Guided by experimental measurements of low catalytic activity in seven single-point mutation AdK variants (K13Q, R36A, R88A, R123A, R156K, R167A, and D158A), we utilized classical mechanical simulations to probe mutant dynamics linked to product release, and quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical calculations to compute a free energy barrier for the catalytic event. The goal was to establish a mechanistic connection between the two activities. Our calculations of the free energy barriers in AdK variants were in line with those from experiments, and conformational dynamics consistently demonstrated an enhanced tendency toward enzyme opening. This indicates that the catalytic residues in the wild-type AdK serve a dual role in this enzyme's function-one to lower the energy barrier for the phosphoryl transfer reaction and another to delay enzyme opening, maintaining it in a catalytically active, closed conformation for long enough to enable the subsequent chemical step. Our study also discovers that while each catalytic residue individually contributes to facilitating the catalysis, R36, R123, R156, R167, and D158 are organized in a tightly coordinated interaction network and collectively modulate AdK's conformational transitions. Unlike the existing notion of product release being rate-limiting, our results suggest a mechanistic interconnection between the chemical step and the enzyme's conformational dynamics acting as the bottleneck of the catalytic process. Our results also suggest that the enzyme's active site has evolved to optimize the chemical reaction step while slowing down the overall opening dynamics of the enzyme.},
