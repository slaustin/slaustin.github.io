abstract: Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AdK) is a small, monomeric enzyme that
  synchronizes the catalytic step with the enzyme's conformational dynamics to optimize
  a phosphoryl transfer reaction and the subsequent release of the product. Guided
  by experimental measurements of low catalytic activity in seven single-point mutation
  AdK variants (K13Q, R36A, R88A, R123A, R156K, R167A, and D158A), we utilized classical
  mechanical simulations to probe mutant dynamics linked to product release, and quantum
  mechanical and molecular mechanical calculations to compute a free energy barrier
  for the catalytic event. The goal was to establish a mechanistic connection between
  the two activities. Our calculations of the free energy barriers in AdK variants
  were in line with those from experiments, and conformational dynamics consistently
  demonstrated an enhanced tendency toward enzyme opening. This indicates that the
  catalytic residues in the wild-type AdK serve a dual role in this enzyme's function-one
  to lower the energy barrier for the phosphoryl transfer reaction and another to
  delay enzyme opening, maintaining it in a catalytically active, closed conformation
  for long enough to enable the subsequent chemical step. Our study also discovers
  that while each catalytic residue individually contributes to facilitating the catalysis,
  R36, R123, R156, R167, and D158 are organized in a tightly coordinated interaction
  network and collectively modulate AdK's conformational transitions. Unlike the existing
  notion of product release being rate-limiting, our results suggest a mechanistic
  interconnection between the chemical step and the enzyme's conformational dynamics
  acting as the bottleneck of the catalytic process. Our results also suggest that
  the enzyme's active site has evolved to optimize the chemical reaction step while
  slowing down the overall opening dynamics of the enzyme.
