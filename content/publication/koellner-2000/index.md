abstract: Buried water molecules and the water molecules in the active-site gorge
  are analyzed for five crystal structures of acetylcholinesterase from Torpedo californica
  in the resolution range 2.2-2.5 Å (native enzyme, and four inhibitor complexes).
  A total of 45 buried hydration sites are identified, which are populated with between
  36 and 41 water molecules. About half of the buried water is located in a distinct
  region neighboring the active-site gorge. Most of the buried water molecules are
  very well conserved among the five structures, and have low displacement parameters,
  B, of magnitudes similar to those of the main-chain atoms of the central $β$-sheet
  structure. The active-site gorge of the native enzyme is filled with over 20 water
  molecules, which have poor hydrogen-bond coordination with an average of 2.9 polar
  contacts per water molecule. Upon ligand binding, distinct groups of these water
  molecules are displaced, whereas the others remain in positions similar to those
  that they occupy in the native enzyme. Possible roles of the buried water molecules
  are discussed, including their possible action as a lubricant to allow large-amplitude
  fluctuations of the loop structures forming the gorge wall. Such fluctuations are
  required to facilitate traffic of substrate, products and water molecules to and
  from the active-site. Because of their poor coordination, the gorge water molecules
  can be considered as 'activated' as compared to bulk water. This should allow their
  easy displacement by incoming substrate. The relatively loose packing of the gorge
  water molecules leaves numerous small voids, and more efficient space-filling by
  substrates and inhibitors may be a major driving force of ligand binding. (C) 2000
