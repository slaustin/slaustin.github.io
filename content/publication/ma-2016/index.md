abstract: oÌ§pyright 2016 American Chemical Society.Allostery is the phenomenon in
  which a ligand binding at one site affects other sites in the same macromolecule.
  Allostery has important roles in many biological processes. Theoretically, all nonfibrous
  proteins are potentially allosteric. However, few allosteric proteins have been
  validated, and the identification of novel allosteric sites remains a challenge.
  The motion of residues and subunits underlies protein function; therefore, we hypothesized
  that the motions of allosteric and orthosteric sites are correlated. We utilized
  a data set of 24 known allosteric sites from 23 monomer proteins to calculate the
  correlations between potential ligand-binding sites and corresponding orthosteric
  sites using a Gaussian network model (GNM). Most of the known allosteric site motions
  showed high correlations with corresponding orthosteric site motions, whereas other
  surface cavities did not. These high correlations were robust when using different
  structural data for the same protein, such as structures for the apo state and the
  orthosteric effector-binding state, whereas the contributions of different frequency
  modes to motion correlations depend on the given protein. The high correlations
  between allosteric and orthosteric site motions were also observed in oligomeric
  allosteric proteins. We applied motion correlation analysis to predict potential
  allosteric sites in the 23 monomer proteins, and some of these predictions were
  in good agreement with published experimental data. We also performed motion correlation
  analysis to identify a novel allosteric site in 15-lipoxygenase (an enzyme in the
  arachidonic acid metabolic network) using recently reported activating compounds.
  Our analysis correctly identified this novel allosteric site along with two other
  sites that are currently under experimental investigation. Our study demonstrates
  that the motions of allosteric sites are highly correlated with the motions of orthosteric
  sites. Our correlation analysis method provides new tools for predicting potential
  allosteric sites.
