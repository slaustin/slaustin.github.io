abstract: We present a simple approach to calculate the kinetic properties of lipid
  membrane crossing processes from biased molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate
  that by using biased simulations, one can obtain highly accurate kinetic information
  with significantly reduced computational time with respect to unbiased simulations.
  We describe how to conveniently calculate the transition rates to enter, cross and
  exit the membrane in terms of mean first passage times. To obtain free energy barriers
  and relaxation times from biased simulations only, we constructed Markov models
  using the Dynamic Histogram Analysis Method (DHAM). The permeability coefficients
  that are calculated from the relaxation times are found to correlate highly with
  experimentally evaluated values. We show that more generally, certain calculated
  kinetic properties linked to the cross-ing of the membrane layer (e.g., barrier
  height and barrier crossing rates) are good indicators of ordering drugs by permeabil-ity.
