abstract: We have developed a self-consistent description of an interface between
  a metal and a molecular liquid by combination of the density functional theory in
  the Kohn--Sham formulation (KS DFT) for the electronic structure, and the three-dimensional
  generalization of the reference interaction site model (3D RISM) for the classical
  site distribution profiles of liquid. The electron and classical subsystems are
  coupled in the mean field approximation. The procedure takes account of many-body
  effects of dense fluid on the metal--liquid interactions by averaging the pseudopotentials
  of liquid molecules over the classical distributions of the liquid. The proposed
  approach is substantially less time-consuming as compared to a Car--Parrinello-type
  simulation since it replaces molecular dynamics with the integral equation theory
  of molecular liquids. The calculation has been performed for pure water at normal
  conditions in contact with the 100 face cubic centered fcc surface of a metal
  roughly modeled after copper. The results are in good agreement with the Car--Parrinello
  simulation for the same metal model. The shift of the Fermi level due to the presence
  of water conforms with experiment. The electron distribution near an adsorbed water
  molecule is affected by dense water, and so the metal--water attraction follows
  the shapes of the metal effective electrostatic potential. For the metal model employed,
  it is strongest at the hollow site adsorption positions, and water molecules are
  adsorbed mainly at the hollow and bridge site positions rather than over metal atoms.
  Layering of water molecules near the metal surface is found. In the first hydration
  layer, adsorbed water molecules are oriented in parallel to the surface or tilted
  with hydrogens mainly outwards the metal. This orientation at the potential of zero
  charge agrees with experiment.
