 abstract = {We have developed a self-consistent description of an interface between a metal and a molecular liquid by combination of the density functional theory in the Kohn--Sham formulation (KS DFT) for the electronic structure, and the three-dimensional generalization of the reference interaction site model (3D RISM) for the classical site distribution profiles of liquid. The electron and classical subsystems are coupled in the mean field approximation. The procedure takes account of many-body effects of dense fluid on the metal--liquid interactions by averaging the pseudopotentials of liquid molecules over the classical distributions of the liquid. The proposed approach is substantially less time-consuming as compared to a Car--Parrinello-type simulation since it replaces molecular dynamics with the integral equation theory of molecular liquids. The calculation has been performed for pure water at normal conditions in contact with the 100 face cubic centered fcc surface of a metal roughly modeled after copper. The results are in good agreement with the Car--Parrinello simulation for the same metal model. The shift of the Fermi level due to the presence of water conforms with experiment. The electron distribution near an adsorbed water molecule is affected by dense water, and so the metal--water attraction follows the shapes of the metal effective electrostatic potential. For the metal model employed, it is strongest at the hollow site adsorption positions, and water molecules are adsorbed mainly at the hollow and bridge site positions rather than over metal atoms. Layering of water molecules near the metal surface is found. In the first hydration layer, adsorbed water molecules are oriented in parallel to the surface or tilted with hydrogens mainly outwards the metal. This orientation at the potential of zero charge agrees with experiment.},
