abstract: Time-resolved emission measurements-of the solute coumarin 153 (C153) are
  used to probe the time dependence of solvation in 24 common solvents at room temperature.
  Significant improvements in experimental time resolution (similar to 100 fs instrument
  response) as well as corresponding improvements in analysis methods provide confidence
  that all of the spectral evolution (including both the inertial and the diffusive
  parts of the response) are observed in these measurements. Extensive data concerning
  the steady-state solvatochromism of C153, coupled to an examination of the effects
  of vibrational relaxation, further demonstrate that the spectral dynamics being
  observed accurately monitor the dynamics of nonspecific solvation. Comparisons to
  theoretical predictions show that models based on the dielectric response of the
  pure solvent provide a semiquantitative understanding of the dynamics observed
