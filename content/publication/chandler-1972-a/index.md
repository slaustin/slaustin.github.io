abstract: The optimized cluster expansion methods developed in the first article of
  this series (I) are generalized to apply to molecular fluids. These methods make
  use of summations of ring and chain cluster diagrams. The summations are performed
  explicitly for certain classes of molecular models. The molecules in these classes
  contain several \"interaction sites,\" and the total interaction between two molecules
  is a sum of site-site potentials that depend on the scalar distances between sites
  on the two molecules. The principal results of this work are computationally simple
  techniques for calculating the thermodynamic properties and pair correlation functions
  of molecular fluids in which the intermolecular interactions are highly angular
  dependent. The techniques should be reliable since they arise from the same approximations
  that have been shown to be very accurate when applied to simple fluids.
