abstract: The authors present a new method for searching low free energy paths in
  complex molecular systems at finite temperature. They introduce two variables that
  are able to describe the position of a point in configurational space relative to
  a preassigned path. With the help of these two variables the authors combine features
  of approaches such as metadynamics or umbrella sampling with those of path based
  methods. This allows global searches in the space of paths to be performed and a
  new variational principle for the determination of low free energy paths to be established.
  Contrary to metadynamics or umbrella sampling the path can be described by an arbitrary
  large number of variables, still the energy profile along the path can be calculated.
  The authors exemplify the method numerically by studying the conformational changes
  of alanine dipeptide.
