abstract: Capillary waves occurring at the liquid-vapor interface of water are studied
  using molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, the surface tension, determined
  thermodynamically from the difference in the normal and tangential pressure at the
  liquid-vapor interface, is compared for a number of standard three- and four-point
  water models. We study four three-point models (SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP3P-CHARMM, and
  TIP3P-Ew) and two four-point models (TIP4P and TIP4P-Ew). All of the models examined
  underestimate the surface tension; the TIP4P-Ew model comes closest to reproducing
  the experimental data. The surface tension can also be determined from the amplitude
  of capillary waves at the liquid-vapor interface by varying the surface area of
  the interface. The surface tensions determined from the amplitude of the logarithmic
  divergence of the capillary interfacial width and from the traditional thermodynamic
  method agree only if the density profile is fitted to an error function instead
  of a hyperbolic tangent function.
