abstract: Eukayotic protein kinases evolved as a family of highly dynamic molecules
  with strictly organized internal architecture. A single hydrophobic F-helix serves
  as a central scaffold for assembly of the entire molecule. Two non-consecutive hydrophobic
  structures termed \" spines\" anchor all the elements important for catalysis to
  the F-helix. They make firm, but flexible, connections within the molecule, providing
  a high level of internal dynamics of the protein kinase. During the course of evolution,
  protein kinases developed a universal regulatory mechanism associated with a large
  activation segment that can be dynamically folded and unfolded in the course of
  cell functioning. Protein kinases thus represent a unique, highly dynamic, and precisely
  regulated set of switches that control most biological events in eukaryotic cells.
