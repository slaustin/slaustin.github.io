abstract: 'Protein motions are essential for function. Comparing protein processes
  with the dielectric fluctuations of the surrounding solvent shows that they fall
  into two classes: nonslaved and slaved. Nonslaved processes are independent of the
  solvent motions; their rates are determined by the protein conformation and vibrational
  dynamics. Slaved processes are tightly coupled to the solvent; their rates have
  approximately the same temperature dependence as the rate of the solvent fluctuations,
  but they are smaller. Because the temperature dependence is determined by the activation
  enthalpy, we propose that the solvent is responsible for the activation enthalpy,
  whereas the protein and the hydration shell control the activation entropy through
  the energy landscape. Bond formation is the prototype of nonslaved processes; opening
  and closing of channels are quintessential slaved motions. The prevalence of slaved
  motions highlights the importance of the environment in cells and membranes for
  the function of proteins.'
