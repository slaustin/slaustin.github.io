abstract: Conformational changes are crucial for the catalytic action of many enzymes.
  A prototypical and well-studied example is loop opening and closure in triosephosphate
  isomerase (TIM), which is thought to determine the rate of catalytic turnover in
  many circumstances. Specifically, TIM loop 6 \"grips\" the phosphodianion of the
  substrate and, together with a change in loop 7, sets up the TIM active site for
  efficient catalysis. Crystal structures of TIM typically show an open or a closed
  conformation of loop 6, with the tip of the loop moving $∼$7 Å between conformations.
  Many studies have interpreted this motion as a two-state, rigid-body transition.
  Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations, with both conventional and
  enhanced sampling techniques, to analyze loop motion in apo and substrate-bound
  TIM in detail, using five crystal structures of the dimeric TIM from Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. We find that loop 6 is highly flexible and samples multiple conformational
  states. Empirical valence bond simulations of the first reaction step show that
  slight displacements away from the fully closed-loop conformation can be sufficient
  to abolish most of the catalytic activity; full closure is required for efficient
  reaction. The conformational change of the loops in TIM is thus not a simple \"open
  and shut\" case and is crucial for its catalytic action. Our detailed analysis of
  loop motion in a highly efficient enzyme highlights the complexity of loop conformational
  changes and their role in biological catalysis.
