abstract: Exploring the free-energy landscape along reaction coordinates or system
  parameters $lambda$ is central to many studies of high-dimensional model systems
  in physics, e.g. large molecules or spin glasses. In simulations this usually requires
  sampling conformational transitions or phase transitions, but efficient sampling
  is often difficult to attain due to the roughness of the energy landscape. For Boltzmann
  distributions, crossing rates decrease exponentially with free-energy barrier heights.
  Thus, exponential acceleration can be achieved in simulations by applying an artificial
  bias along $lambda$ tuned such that a flat target distribution is obtained. A flat
  distribution is however an ambiguous concept unless a proper metric is used, and
  is generally suboptimal. Here we propose a multidimensional Riemann metric, which
  takes the local diffusion into account, and redefine uniform sampling such that
  it is invariant under nonlinear coordinate transformations. We use the metric in
  combination with the accelerated weight histogram method, a free-energy calculation
  and sampling method, to adaptively optimize sampling toward the target distribution
  prescribed by the metric. We demonstrate that for complex problems, such as molecular
  dynamics simulations of DNA base-pair opening, sampling uniformly according to the
  metric, which can be calculated without significant computational overhead, improves
  sampling efficiency by 50-70%.
