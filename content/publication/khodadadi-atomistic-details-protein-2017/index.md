abstract: "Background The importance of protein dynamics for their biological activity
  is now well recognized. Different experimental and computational techniques have
  been employed to study protein dynamics, hierarchy of different processes and the
  coupling between protein and hydration water dynamics. Yet, understanding the atomistic
  details of protein dynamics and the role of hydration water remains rather limited.
  Scoop of review Based on overview of neutron scattering, molecular dynamic simulations,
  NMR and dielectric spectroscopy results we present a general picture of protein
  dynamics covering time scales from faster than ps to microseconds and the influence
  of hydration water on different relaxation processes. Major conclusions Internal
  protein dynamics spread over a wide time range from faster than picosecond to longer
  than microseconds. We suggest that the structural relaxation in hydrated proteins
  appears on the microsecond time scale, while faster processes present mostly motion
  of side groups and some domains. Hydration water plays a crucial role in protein
  dynamics on all time scales. It controls the coupled protein-hydration water relaxation
  on 10--100 ps time scale. This process defines the friction for slower protein dynamics.
  Analysis suggests that changes in amount of hydration water affect not only general
  friction, but also influence significantly the protein's energy landscape. General
  significance The proposed atomistic picture of protein dynamics provides deeper
  understanding of various relaxation processes and their hierarchy, similarity and
  differences between various biological macromolecules, including proteins, DNA and
  RNA. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ``Science for Life'' Guest
