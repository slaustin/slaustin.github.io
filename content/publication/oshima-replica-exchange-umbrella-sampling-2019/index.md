abstract: 'We have developed an enhanced conformational sampling method combining
  replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS) with Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics
  (GaMD). REUS enhances the sampling along predefined reaction coordinates, while
  GaMD accelerates the conformational dynamics by adding a boost potential to the
  system energy. The method, which we call GaREUS (Gaussian accelerated replica-exchange
  umbrella sampling), enhances the sampling more efficiently than REUS or GaMD, while
  the computational resource for GaREUS is the same as that required for REUS. The
  two-step reweighting procedure using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method
  and the cumulant expansion for the exponential average is applied to the simulation
  trajectories for obtaining the unbiased free-energy landscapes. We apply GaREUS
  to the calculations of free-energy landscapes for three different cases: conformational
  equilibria of N-glycan, folding of chignolin, and conformational change of adenyl
  kinase. We show that GaREUS speeds up the convergences of free-energy calculations
  using the same amount of computational resources as REUS. The free-energy landscapes
  reweighted from the trajectories of GaREUS agree with previously reported ones.
  GaREUS is applicable to free-energy calculations of various biomolecular dynamics
  and functions with reasonable computational costs.'
