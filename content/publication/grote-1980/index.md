abstract: The time correlation function (tcf) formulas for rate constants $ıota$ derived
  via the stable states picture (SSP) of chemical reactions are applied to a wide
  variety (a-d) of gas and solution phase reaction models, (a) For gas phase bimolecular
  reactions, we show that the flux tcf governing $ąppa$ corresponds to standard numerical
  trajectory calculation methods. Alternate formulas for $p̨pa$ are derived which
  focus on saddle point surfaces, thus increasing computational efficiency. Advantages
  of the SSP formulas for are discussed. (b) For gas phase unimolecular reactions,
  simple results for $kp̨a$ are found in both the strong and weak coupling collision
  limits; the often ignored role of product stabilization is exposed for reversible
  isomerizations. The SSP results correct some standard weak coupling rate constant
  results by as much as 50%. (c) For barrier crossing reactions in solution, we evaluate
  $kaą$ for a generalized (nonMarkovian) Langevin description of the dynamics. For
  several realistic models of time dependent friction, $kap$̨ differs dramatically
  from the popular Kramers constant friction predictions; this has important implications
  for the validity of transition state theory. (d) For solution reactions heavily
  influenced by spatial diffusion, we show that the SSP isolates short range reaction
  dynamics of interest and includes important barrier region effects in structural
  isomerizations often missed in standard descriptions. o̧pyright 1980 American Institute
