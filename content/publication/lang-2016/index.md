abstract: Allosteric regulation of protein function, the process by which binding
  of an effector molecule provokes a functional response from a distal site, is critical
  for metabolic pathways. Yet, the way the allosteric signal is communicated remains
  elusive, especially in dynamic, entropically driven regulation mechanisms for which
  no major conformational changes are observed. To identify these dynamic allosteric
  communication networks, we have developed an approach that monitors the pKa variations
  of ionizable residues over the course of molecular dynamics simulations performed
  in the presence and absence of an allosteric regulator. As the pKa of ionizable
  residues depends on their environment, it represents a simple metric to monitor
  changes in several complex factors induced by binding an allosteric effector. These
  factors include Coulombic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation, as well
  as backbone motions and side chain fluctuations. The predictions that can be made
  with this method concerning the rol...
