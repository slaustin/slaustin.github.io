abstract: Conformational dynamics are increasingly recognized as being essential for
  enzyme function. However, there is virtually no direct experimental evidence to
  support the notion that individual dynamic modes are required for specific catalytic
  processes, apart from the initial step of substrate binding. In this work, we use
  a unique approach based on millisecond hydrogen--deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
  to identify dynamic modes linked to individual catalytic processes in the antibiotic
  resistance enzyme TEM-1 $β$-lactamase. Using a ``good'' substrate (ampicillin),
  a poorly hydrolyzed substrate (cephalexin) and a covalent inhibitor (clavulanate),
  we are able to isolate dynamic modes that are specifically linked to substrate binding,
  productive lactam ring hydrolysis and deacylation. These discoveries are ultimately
  translated into specific targets for allosteric TEM-1 inhibitor development.
