 abstract = {Conformational dynamics are increasingly recognized as being essential for enzyme function. However, there is virtually no direct experimental evidence to support the notion that individual dynamic modes are required for specific catalytic processes, apart from the initial step of substrate binding. In this work, we use a unique approach based on millisecond hydrogen--deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to identify dynamic modes linked to individual catalytic processes in the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 $β$-lactamase. Using a ``good'' substrate (ampicillin), a poorly hydrolyzed substrate (cephalexin) and a covalent inhibitor (clavulanate), we are able to isolate dynamic modes that are specifically linked to substrate binding, productive lactam ring hydrolysis and deacylation. These discoveries are ultimately translated into specific targets for allosteric TEM-1 inhibitor development.},
