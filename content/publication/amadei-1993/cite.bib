 abstract = {Analysis of extended molecu-lar dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in vacuo and in aqueous solution reveals that it is possible to separate the configurational space into two subspaces: (1) an " essential " subspace containing only a few degrees of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that com-prises most of the positional fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian distribution and which can be considered as " physically constrained. " If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hun-dred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional de-viations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrele-vant local fluctuations. The near-constraint be-havior of the latter subspace allows the separa-tion of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simu-lations only in this reduced space.},
