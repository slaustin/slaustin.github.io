abstract: 'The pyridoxal 5$prime$-phosphate (PLP) acts as a coenzyme for a large number
  of biochemical reactions. It exists in mainly two bound forms at the active site
  of the concerned enzyme: the internal aldimine, in which the PLP is bound with the
  $Îµ$-amino group of lysine at the active site, and the external aldimine, where the
  PLP is bound to the substrate amino acid. Both the internal and external aldimines
  have Schiff base linkage (N--H--O) and can exist in two tautomeric structures of
  ketoenamine and enolimine forms. In this work, we have investigated the free energy
  landscape for the tautomeric proton transfer in the internal and external aldimines
  at the active site of the ornithine decarboxylase enzyme in an aqueous medium. We
  performed hybrid quantum-classical metadynamics and force field-based molecular
  dynamics simulations, which revealed that the ketoenamine tautomer is more stable
  than the enolimine form. The QM/MM metadynamics calculations show that the free
  energy difference between the ketoenamine and enolimine forms for the internal aldimine
  is 3.9 kcal/mol, and it is found to be 5.8 kcal/mol for the external aldimine, with
  the ketoenamine form being more stable in both cases. The results are further supported
  by calculations of the binding free energies from classical simulations and static
  quantum chemical calculations in different environments. We have also analyzed the
  configurational structure of the microenvironment at the active site in order to
  have better insights into the interactions of the active site residues with the
  PLP in its two tautomeric forms.'
