abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the need often arises to maintain
  such parameters as temperature or pressure rather than energy and volume, or to
  impose gradients for studying transport properties in nonequilibrium MD. A method
  is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant temperature or
  pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The method is easily extendable
  to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules
  involving internal constraints. The influence of coupling time constants on dynamical
  variables is evaluated. A leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case
  involving constraints with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant
  pressure bath. oÌ§pyright 1984 American Institute of Physics.
