abstract: Allosteric drugs, which bind to proteins in regions other than their main
  ligand-binding or active sites, make it possible to target proteins considered aundruggableo
  and to develop new therapies that circumvent existing resistance. Despite growing
  interest in allosteric drug discovery, rational design is limited by a lack of sufficient
  structural information about alternative binding sites in proteins. Previously,
  we used Markov State Models (MSMs) to identify such acryptic pockets,o and here
  we describe a method for identifying compounds that bind in these cryptic pockets
  and modulate enzyme activity. Experimental tests validate our approach by revealing
  both an inhibitor and two activators of TEM $Î²$-lactamase (TEM). To identify hits,
  a library of compounds is first virtually screened against either the crystal structure
  of a known cryptic pocket or an ensemble of structures containing the same cryptic
  pocket that is extracted from an MSM. Hit compounds are then screened experimentally
  and characterized kinetically in individual assays. We identify three hits, one
  inhibitor and two activators, demonstrating that screening for binding to allosteric
  sites can result in both positive and negative modulation. The hit compounds have
  modest effects on TEM activity, but all have higher affinities than previously identified
  inhibitors, which bind the same cryptic pocket but were found, by chance, via a
  computational screen targeting the active site. Sitedirected mutagenesis of key
  contact residues predicted by the docking models is used to confirm that the compounds
  bind in the cryptic pocket as intended. Because hit compounds are identified from
  docking against both the crystal structure and structures from the MSM, this platform
  should prove suitable for many proteins, particularly targets whose crystal structures
  lack obvious druggable pockets, and for identifying both inhibitory and activating
  small-molecule modulators.
