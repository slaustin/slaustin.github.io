abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze collective vibrations in
  the hydration water of a small globular protein. We develop tools that allow spatial
  resolution of correlated protein and water motion, and use them to reveal correlated
  vibrations that extend up to 10 A ÌŠ  from the protein surface at far-infrared/THz
  frequencies that are sensitive to the chemical properties of the protein surface.
  Our results provide the first detailed description of long-range effects on protein
  hydration water dynamics and highlight the differences between single particle and
  collective dynamics, which are relevant in interpreting experimental observations.
