abstract: In recent years, considerable progress has been made to enhance sampling
  and help address biological questions, including, but not limited to conformational
  transitions in biomolecules and protein--ligand reversible binding, hitherto intractable
  by brute-force computer simulations. Many of these advances result from the development
  of a palette of methods aimed at exploring rare events through reliable free-energy
  calculations. The advent of new, often conceptually related methods has also rendered
  difficult the choice of the best suited option for a given problem. Here, we focus
  on geometrical transformations and algorithms designed to enhance sampling along
  adequately chosen progress variables, tracing their theoretical foundations, and
  showing how they are connected and can be blended together for improved performance.
