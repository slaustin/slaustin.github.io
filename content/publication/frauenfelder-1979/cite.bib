 abstract = {X-ray diffraction at four temperatures from 220 to 300 K coupled with crystallographic refinement yields the mean-square displacements and conformational potentials of all 1,261 non-hydrogen atoms of metmyoglobin. The results are interpreted to indicate a condensed core around the haem, semi-liquid regions towards the outside and a possible pathway for ligands. It is concluded that X-ray diffraction can provide the spatial distribution of the dynamic features of a protein. oÌ§pyright 1979 Nature Publishing Group.},
