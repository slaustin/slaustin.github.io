abstract: X-ray diffraction at four temperatures from 220 to 300 K coupled with crystallographic
  refinement yields the mean-square displacements and conformational potentials of
  all 1,261 non-hydrogen atoms of metmyoglobin. The results are interpreted to indicate
  a condensed core around the haem, semi-liquid regions towards the outside and a
  possible pathway for ligands. It is concluded that X-ray diffraction can provide
  the spatial distribution of the dynamic features of a protein. oÌ§pyright 1979 Nature
