abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has emerged as a new and important member in the
  group of gaseous signaling molecules. However, the molecular transport mechanism
  has not yet been identified. Because of structural similarities with H2O, it was
  hypothesized that aquaporins may facilitate H2S transport across cell membranes.
  We tested this hypothesis by reconstituting the archeal aquaporin AfAQP from sulfide
  reducing bacteria Archaeoglobus fulgidus into planar membranes and by monitoring
  the resulting facilitation of osmotic water flow and H2S flux. To measure H2O and
  H2S fluxes, respectively, sodium ion dilution and buffer acidification by proton
  release (H2S ⇆ H++ HS-) were recorded in the immediate membrane vicinity. Both sodium
  ion concentration and pH were measured by scanning ion-selective microelectrodes.
  A lower limit of lipid bilayer permeability to H2S, PM,H2S$>$ 0.5 textpm 0.4 cm/s
  was calculated by numerically solving the complete system of differential reaction
  diffusion equations and fitting the theoretical pH distribution to experimental
  pH profiles. Even though reconstitution of AfAQP significantly increased water permeability
  through planar lipid bilayers, PM,H2Sremained unchanged. These results indicate
  that lipid membranes may well act as a barrier to water transport although they
  do not oppose a significant resistance to H2S diffusion. The fact that cholesterol
  and sphingomyelin reconstitution did not turn these membranes into an H2S barrier
  indicates that H2S transport through epithelial barriers, endothelial barriers,
  and membrane rafts also occurs by simple diffusion and does not require facilitation
  by membrane channels.
