abstract: The Abl-SH3 domain is implicated in negative regulation of the Abl kinase
  by mediating protein-protein interactions. High-affinity SH3 ligands could compete
  for these interactions and specifically activate the Abl kinase, providing control
  and a better understanding of the molecular interactions that underlie diseases
  where SH3 domains are involved. The p41 peptide (APSYSPPPPP) is a member of a group
  of peptide ligands designed to bind specifically the Abl-SH3 domain. It binds to
  Abl-SH3 with a K(d) of 1.5 $μ$M, whereas its affinity for the Fyn-SH3 domain is
  273 $μ$M. We have determined the crystal structure of the Abl-SH3 domain in complex
  with the high-affinity peptide ligand p41 at 1.6 Å resolution. In the crystal structure,
  this peptide adopts a polyproline type II helix conformation through residue 5 to
  10, and it binds in type I orientation to the Abl-SH3 domain. The tyrosine side-chain
  in position 4 of the peptide is hydrogen bonded to two residues in the RT-loop of
  the Abl-SH3 domain. The tight fit of this side-chain into the RT-loop pocket is
  enhanced by conformational adjustment of the main chain at position 5. The SH3 ligand
  peptides can be divided into two distinct parts. The N-terminal part binds to the
  SH3 domain in the region formed by the valley between the nSrc and RT-loops. It
  determines the specificity for different SH3 domains. The C-terminal part adopts
  a polyproline type II helix conformation. This binds to a well-conserved hydrophobic
  surface of the SH3 domain. Analysis of two 'half'-peptides, corresponding to these
  ligand parts, shows that both are essential components for strong binding to the
  SH3 domains. The crystal structure of the Abl-SH3:p41 complex explains the high
  affinity and specificity of the p41 peptide towards the Abl-SH3 domain, and reveals
  principles that will be exploited for future design of small, high-affinity ligands
  to interfere efficiently with the in vivo regulation of Abl kinase activity.
