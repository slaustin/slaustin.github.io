abstract: It has recently become practical to construct Markov state models (MSMs)
  that reproduce the long-time statistical conformational dynamics of biomolecules
  using data from molecular dynamics simulations. MSMs can predict both stationary
  and kinetic quantities on long timescales (e.g. milliseconds) using a set of atomistic
  molecular dynamics simulations that are individually much shorter, thus addressing
  the well-known sampling problem in molecular dynamics simulation. In addition to
  providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction
  of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics)
  and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments.
  A variety of methodological advances and software packages now bring the construction
  of these models closer to routine practice. Here, we review recent progress in this
  field, considering theoretical and methodological advances, new software tools,
  and recent applications of these approaches in several domains of biochemistry and
  biophysics, commenting on remaining challenges. o̧pyright 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
