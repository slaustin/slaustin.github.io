abstract: The bacterial metabolic enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate synthase (DXPS)
  catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent formation of DXP from pyruvate
  and Dglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-GAP). DXP is an essential bacteriaspecific metabolite
  that feeds into the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), and
  ThDP. DXPS catalyzes the activation of pyruvate to give the C2$α$-lactylThDP (LThDP)
  adduct that is long-lived on DXPS in a closed state in the absence of the cosubstrate.
  Binding of D-GAP shifts the DXPS-LThDP complex to an open state which coincides
  with LThDP decarboxylation. This gated mechanism distinguishes DXPS in ThDP enzymology.
  How LThDP persists on DXPS in the absence of cosubstrate, while other pyruvate decarboxylases
  readily activate LThDP for decarboxylation, is a long-standing question in the field.
  We propose that an active site network functions to prevent LThDP activation on
  DXPS until the cosubstrate binds. Binding of D-GAP coincides with a conformational
  shift and disrupts the network causing changes in the active site that promote LThDP
  activation. Here, we show that the substitution of putative network residues, as
  well as nearby residues believed to contribute to network charge distribution, predictably
  affects LThDP reactivity. Substitutions predicted to disrupt the network have the
  effect to activate LThDP for decarboxylation, resulting in CO2 and acetate production.
  In contrast, a substitution predicted to strengthen the network fails to activate
  LThDP and has the effect to shift DXPS toward the closed state. Network-disrupting
  substitutions near the carboxylate of LThDP also have a pronounced effect to shift
  DXPS to an open state. These results offer initial insights to explain the long-lived
  LThDP intermediate and its activation through disruption of an active site network,
  which is unique to DXPS. These findings have important implications for DXPS function
  in bacteria and its development as an antibacterial target.
