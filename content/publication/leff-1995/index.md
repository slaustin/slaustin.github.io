abstract: Over the past few years, the concept that the activation of G protein-coupled
  receptors and transmitter-gated ion channels depends on a conformational change
  has received increasingly widespread acceptance. As a result, these two structurally
  distinct families of receptors can now be considered to obey a similar two-state
  mechanism. However, traditional receptor theory has largely overlooked this concept.
  In this article, Paul Leff explains and illustrates the predictions of the two-state
  model of receptor activation and discusses its impact on the analysis and interpretation
  of agonist-receptor interactions. oÌ§pyright 1995.
