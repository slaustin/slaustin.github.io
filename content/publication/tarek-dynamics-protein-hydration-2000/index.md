abstract: We present results from an extensive molecular dynamics simulation study
  of water hydrating the protein Ribonuclease A, at a series of temperatures in cluster,
  crystal, and powder environments. The dynamics of protein hydration water appear
  to be very similar in crystal and powder environments at moderate to high hydration
  levels. Thus, we contend that experiments performed on powder samples are appropriate
  for discussing hydration water dynamics in native protein environments. Our analysis
  reveals that simulations performed on cluster models consisting of proteins surrounded
  by a finite water shell with free boundaries are not appropriate for the study of
  the solvent dynamics. Detailed comparison to available x-ray diffraction and inelastic
  neutron-scattering data shows that current generation force fields are capable of
  accurately reproducing the structural and dynamical observables. On the time scale
  of tens of picoseconds, at room temperature and high hydration, significant water
  translational diffusion and rotational motion occur. At low hydration, the water
  molecules are translationally confined but display appreciable rotational motion.
  Below the protein dynamical transition temperature, both translational and rotational
  motions of the water molecules are essentially arrested. Taken together, these results
  suggest that water translational motion is necessary for the structural relaxation
  that permits anharmonic and diffusive motions in proteins. Furthermore, it appears
  that the exchange of protein-water hydrogen bonds by water rotational/librational
  motion is not sufficient to permit protein structural relaxation. Rather, the complete
  exchange of protein-bound water molecules by translational displacement seems to
  be required.
