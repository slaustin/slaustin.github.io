abstract: Detailed understanding of how conformational dynamics orchestrates function
  in allosteric regulation of recognition and catalysis remains ambiguous. Here, we
  simulate CypA using multiple-microsecond-long atomistic molecular dynamics in explicit
  solvent and carry out NMR experiments. We analyze a large amount of time-dependent
  multidimensional data with a coarse-grained approach and map key dynamical features
  within individual macrostates by defining dynamics in terms of residue-residue contacts.
  The effects of substrate binding are observed to be largely sensed at a location
  over 15 Ã… from the active site, implying its importance in allostery. Using NMR
  experiments, we confirm that a dynamic cluster of residues in this distal region
  is directly coupled to the active site. Furthermore, the dynamical network of interresidue
  contacts is found to be coupled and temporally dispersed, ranging over 4 to 5 orders
  of magnitude. Finally, using network centrality measures we demonstrate the changes
  in the communication network, connectivity, and influence of CypA residues upon
  substrate binding, mutation, and during catalysis. We identify key residues that
  potentially act as a bottleneck in the communication flow through the distinct regions
  in CypA and, therefore, as targets for future mutational studies. Mapping these
  dynamical features and the coupling of dynamics to function has crucial ramifications
  in understanding allosteric regulation in enzymes and proteins, in general.
