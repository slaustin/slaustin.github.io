abstract: 'Since its inception nearly a half century ago, CHARMM has been playing
  a central role in computational biochemistry and biophysics. Commensurate with the
  developments in experimental research and advances in computer hardware, the range
  of methods and applicability of CHARMM have also grown. This review summarizes major
  developments that occurred after 2009 when the last review of CHARMM was published.
  They include the following: new faster simulation engines, accessible user interfaces
  for convenient workflows, and a vast array of simulation and analysis methods that
  encompass quantum mechanical, atomistic, and coarse-grained levels, as well as extensive
  coverage of force fields. In addition to providing the current snapshot of the CHARMM
  development, this review may serve as a starting point for exploring relevant theories
  and computational methods for tackling contemporary and emerging problems in biomolecular
  systems. CHARMM is freely available for academic and nonprofit research at https://academiccharmm.org/program.'
