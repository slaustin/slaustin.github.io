  relaxation experiment on macromolecules in solution is specified by a generalized
  order parameter, 8 , and an effective correlation time, 7,. This paper deals with
  the extraction and interpretation of this information. The procedure used to obtain
  S2and T , from experimental data by using a least-squares method and, in certain
  favorable circumstances, by using an analytical formulaisdescribed. 
  Avarietyofexperimentsarethenanalyzedtoyieldinformationonthetimescaleandspatialrestriction
  of internal motions of isoleucines in myoglobin, methionines in dihydrofolate reductase
  and myoglobin, a number of aliphatic residues in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor,
  and ethyl isocyanide bound to myoglobin, hemoglobin, and aliphatic side chains in
  three random-coil polymers. The numerical values of S 2 and 7, can be readily interpreted
  within the framework of a variety of models. In this way, one can obtain the same
  physical picture of internal motions as that obtained by using complicated spectraldensitiestofitthedata.
  Thenumericalvalueoftheorderparameter,unliketheeffectivecorrelationtimeT,, plays
  a crucial role in determining what models can be used to describe the experiment;models
  in which the order parameter cannot bereproducedareeliminated. Conversely,anymodelthatcanyieldthecorrectvalueofSworks.
