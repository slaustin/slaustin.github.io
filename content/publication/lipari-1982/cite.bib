 abstract = {IntheprecedingpaperithasbeenshownthattheuniquedynamicinformationonfastinternalmotionsinanNMR relaxation experiment on macromolecules in solution is specified by a generalized order parameter, 8 , and an effective correlation time, 7,. This paper deals with the extraction and interpretation of this information. The procedure used to obtain S2and T , from experimental data by using a least-squares method and, in certain favorable circumstances, by using an analytical formulaisdescribed. Avarietyofexperimentsarethenanalyzedtoyieldinformationonthetimescaleandspatialrestriction of internal motions of isoleucines in myoglobin, methionines in dihydrofolate reductase and myoglobin, a number of aliphatic residues in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and ethyl isocyanide bound to myoglobin, hemoglobin, and aliphatic side chains in three random-coil polymers. The numerical values of S 2 and 7, can be readily interpreted within the framework of a variety of models. In this way, one can obtain the same physical picture of internal motions as that obtained by using complicated spectraldensitiestofitthedata. Thenumericalvalueoftheorderparameter,unliketheeffectivecorrelationtimeT,, plays a crucial role in determining what models can be used to describe the experiment;models in which the order parameter cannot bereproducedareeliminated.
