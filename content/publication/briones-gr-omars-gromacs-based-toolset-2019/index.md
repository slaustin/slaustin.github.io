abstract: We introduce a computational toolset, named GROma$h̊o$s, to obtain and compare
  time-averaged density maps from molecular dynamics simulations. GROma$o̊$s efficiently
  computes density maps by fast multi-Gaussian spreading of atomic densities onto
  a three-dimensional grid. It complements existing map-based tools by enabling spatial
  inspection of atomic average localization during the simulations. Most importantly,
  it allows the comparison between computed and reference maps (e.g., experimental)
  through calculation of difference maps and local and time-resolved global correlation.
  These comparison operations proved useful to quantitatively contrast perturbed and
  control simulation data sets and to examine how much biomolecular systems resemble
  both synthetic and experimental density maps. This was especially advantageous for
  multimolecule systems in which standard comparisons like RMSDs are difficult to
  compute. In addition, GROma$r$̊s incorporates absolute and relative spatial free-energy
  estimates to provide an energetic picture of atomistic localization. This is an
  open-source GROMACS-based toolset, thus allowing for static or dynamic selection
  of atoms or even coarse-grained beads for the density calculation. Furthermore,
  masking of regions was implemented to speed up calculations and to facilitate the
  comparison with experimental maps. Beyond map comparison, GROma$rh̊s provides a
  straightforward method to detect solvent cavities and average charge distribution
  in biomolecular systems. We employed all these functionalities to inspect the localization
  of lipid and water molecules in aquaporin systems, the binding of cholesterol to
  the G protein coupled chemokine receptor type 4, and the identification of permeation
  pathways through the dermicidin antimicrobial channel. Based on these examples,
  we anticipate a high applicability of GROma$ρs̊ for the analysis of molecular dynamics
  simulations and their comparison with experimentally determined densities.
