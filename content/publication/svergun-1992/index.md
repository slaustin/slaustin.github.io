abstract: A method is proposed for the determination of the optimum value of the regularization
  parameter (Lagrange multiplier) when applying indirect transform techniques in small-angle
  scattering data analysis. The method is based on perceptual criteria of what is
  the best solution. A set of simple criteria is used to construct a total estimate
  describing the quality of the solution. Maximization of the total estimate is straightforward.
  Model computations show the effectiveness of the technique. The method is implemented
  in the program GNOM [Svergun, Semenyuk & Feigin (1988). Acta Cryst. A44, 244-250].
