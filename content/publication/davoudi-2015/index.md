abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo cardiac surgery appear to be at increased
  risk for the development of Nosocomial infections (NIs). The development of antibiotic-resistant
  infections has been associated with significantly greater hospital mortality rates
  compared to similar infections caused by antibiotic-sensitive pathogens.nnOBJECTIVES:
  The purpose of this study is survey of Nis and antibiotic resistance patterns of
  causative bacteria among patients who underwent open heart surgery in the north
  of Iran during a 2-year period between September 2012 and September 2014.nnMETHODS:
  In this cross-sectional study we evaluated 187 patients that underwent open heart
  surgery with NIs. Demographic feature, clinical characteristics and risk factors
  of each infection were recorded. The antibiotic susceptibility test was performed
  using the Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method according to the standard
  protocol of Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Detection of Extended-spectrum
  beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria was performed by the double-disk synergy
  (DDS) test; also Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA) strains were identified
  by MRSA Screen Agar. The collected data were analyzed using the SPSS software (ver.
  16) and, descriptive statistics were used.nnRESULTS: Out Of total of 2253 hospitalized
  patients who underwent open heart surgery, 187(5.05%) patients had NIs. 51.9% of
  the patients were female. The rates of surgical site infection (SSI), respiratory
  tract infection, endocarditis, Urinary tract infection (UTI), blood Infection and
  mediastinitis were 27.80, 25.66%, 17.64, 17.11% 8.55% and 3.20% respectively. E.coli
  and S.aureus were the most causative agents of NIs. The rate of ESBL-producing bacteria
  was 14.28- 71.42% among enterobacteriaceae and the rate of MRSA was 54.2% among
  S.aureus strains. All isolated Acinetobacter.spp were Multi-drug resistance (MDR).nnCONCLUSIONS:
  We showed that the rate of NIs among these high-risk patients was in the average
  level. But the emergence of MRSA and ESBL bacteria is increasing in our region.'
