abstract: Solvent dynamics can play a major role in enzyme activity, but obtaining
  an accurate, quantitative picture of solvent activity during catalysis is quite
  challenging. Here, we combine terahertz spectroscopy and X-ray absorption analyses
  to measure changes in the coupled water-protein motions during peptide hydrolysis
  by a zinc-dependent human metalloprotease. These changes were tightly correlated
  with rearrangements at the active site during the formation of productive enzyme-substrate
  intermediates and were different from those in an enzyme-inhibitor complex. Molecular
  dynamics simulations showed a steep gradient of fast-to-slow coupled protein-water
  motions around the protein, active site and substrate. Our results show that water
  retardation occurs before formation of the functional Michaelis complex. We propose
  that the observed gradient of coupled protein-water motions may assist enzyme-substrate
  interactions through water-polarizing mechanisms that are remotely mediated by the
  catalytic metal ion and the enzyme active site.
