abstract: Protein function originates from a cooperation of structural rigidity, dynamics
  at different timescales, and allostery. However, how these three pillars of protein
  function are integrated is still only poorly understood. Here we show how these
  pillars are connected in Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a drug target
  for diabetes and cancer that catalyzes??the dephosphorylation of numerous substrates
  in essential signaling pathways. By combining new experimental and computational
  data on WT-PTP1B and ???10 PTP1B variants in multiple states, we discovered a fundamental
  and evolutionarily conserved CH/?? switch that is critical for positioning the catalytically
  important WPD loop. Furthermore, our data show that PTP1B uses conformational and
  dynamic allostery to regulate its activity. This shows that both conformational
  rigidity and dynamics are essential for controlling protein activity. This connection
  between rigidity and dynamics at different timescales is likely a hallmark of all
  enzyme function.
