abstract: A heme-dependent conformational rearrangement of the C-terminal domain of
  heme binding protein (PhuS) is required for interaction with the iron-regulated
  heme oxygenase (HemO). Herein, we further investigate the underlying mechanism of
  this conformational rearrangement and its implications for heme transfer via site-directed
  mutagenesis, resonance Raman (RR), hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS) methods,
  and molecular dynamics (MD). HDX-MS revealed that the apo-PhuS C-terminal $α$6/$α$7/$α$8-helices
  are largely unstructured, whereas the apo-PhuS H212R variant showed an increase
  in structure within these regions. The increased rate of heme association with apo-PhuS
  H212R compared with the WT and lack of a detectable five-coordinate high-spin (5cHS)
  heme intermediate are consistent with a more folded and less dynamic C-terminal
  domain. HDX-MS and MD of holo-PhuS indicate an overall reduction in molecular flexibility
  throughout the protein, with significant structural rearrangement and protection
  of the heme binding pocket. We observed slow cooperative unfolding/folding events
  within the C-terminal helices of holo-PhuS and the N-terminal $α$1/$α$2-helices
  that are dampened or eliminated in the holo-PhuS H212R variant. Chemical cross-linking
  and MALDI-TOF MS mapped these same regions to the PhuS:HemO protein-protein interface.
  We previously proposed that the protein-protein interaction induces conformational
  rearrangement, promoting a ligand switch from His-209 to His-212 and triggering
  heme release to HemO. The reduced conformational freedom of holo-PhuS H212R combined
  with the increase in entropy and decrease in heme transfer on interaction with HemO
  further support this model. This study provides significant insight into the role
  of protein dynamics in heme binding and release in bacterial heme transport proteins.
