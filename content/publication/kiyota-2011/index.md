abstract: A new approach to investigate a molecular recognition process of protein
  is presented based on the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM)
  theory, a statistical mechanics theory of molecular liquids. Numerical procedure
  for solving the conventional 3D-RISM equation consists of two steps. In step 1,
  we solve ordinary RISM (or 1D-RISM) equations for a solvent mixture including target
  ligands in order to obtain the density pair correlation functions (PCF) among molecules
  in the solution. Then, we solve the 3D-RISM equation for a solute-solvent system
  to find three-dimensional density distribution functions (3D-DDF) of solvent species
  around a protein, using PCF obtained in the first step. A key to the success of
  the method was to regard a target ligand as one of \"solvent\" species. However,
  the success is limited due to a difficulty of solving the 1D-RISM equation for a
  solvent mixture, including large ligand molecules. In the present paper, we propose
  a method which eases the limitation concerning solute size in the conventional method.
  In this approach, we solve a solute-solute 3D-RISM equations for a protein-ligand
  system in which both proteins and ligands are regarded as \"solutes\" at infinite
  dilution. The 3D- and 1D-RISM equations are solved for protein-solvent and ligand-solvent
  systems, respectively, in order to obtain the 3D- and 1D-DDF of solvent around the
  solutes, which are required for solving the solute-solute 3D-RISM equation. The
  method is applied to two practical and noteworthy examples concerning pharmaceutical
  design. One is an odorant binding protein in the Drosophila melanogaster, which
  binds an ethanol molecule. The other is phospholipase A2, which is known as a receptor
  of acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin. The result indicates that the method successfully
  reproduces the binding mode of the ligand molecules in the binding sites measured
  by the experiments. oÌ§pyright 2011 American Chemical Society.
