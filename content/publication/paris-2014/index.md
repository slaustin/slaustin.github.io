abstract: 'The conformational dynamics of human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated
  by principal component analysis (PCA) applied to three molecular dynamics trajectories
  of 200 ns each. The overlap of the essential subspaces spanned by the first 10 principal
  components (PC) of different trajectories was about 0.3 showing that the PCA based
  on a trajectory length of 200 ns is not completely convergent for this protein.
  The contributions of the relative motion of subdomains and of the subdomains (internal)
  distortion to the first 10 PCs were found to be comparable. Based on the distribution
  of the first 3 PC, 10 protein conformers are identified showing relative root mean
  square deviations (RMSD) between 2.3 and 4.6 Å. The main PCs are found to be delocalized
  over the whole protein structure indicating that the motions of different protein
  subdomains are coupled. This coupling is considered as being related to the allosteric
  effects observed upon ligand binding to HSA. On the other hand, the first PC of
  one of the three trajectories describes a conformational transition of the protein
  domain I that is close to that experimentally observed upon myristate binding. This
  is a theoretical support for the older hypothesis stating that changes of the protein
  onformation favorable to binding can precede the ligand complexation. A detailed
  all atoms PCA performed on the primary Sites 1 and 2 confirms the multiconformational
  character of the HSA binding sites as well as the significant coupling of their
  motions. o̧pyright 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 101: 561-572, 2014.'
