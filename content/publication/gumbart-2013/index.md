abstract: Accurate prediction of standard binding free energies describing protein:ligand
  association remains a daunting computational endeavor. This challenge is rooted
  to a large extent in the considerable changes in conformational, translational and
  rotational entropies underlying the binding process that atomistic simulations cannot
  easily capture. In spite of significant methodological advances, reflected in a
  continuously improving agreement with experiment, a characterization of alternate
  strategies aimed at measuring binding affinities, notably their respective advantages
  and drawbacks, is somewhat lacking. Here, two distinct avenues to determine the
  standard binding free energy are compared in the case of a short, proline-rich peptide
  associating to the Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinase Abl. These avenues -
  one relying upon alchemical transformations and the other on potentials of mean
  force (PMFs) - invoke a series of geometrical restraints acting on collective variables
  designed to alleviate sampling limitations inherent to classical molecular dynamics
  simulations. The experimental binding free energy of $$Δ$$G bind = -7.99 kcal/mol
  is well reproduced by the two strategies developed herein, with $$Δ$$G bind = -7.7
  for the alchemical route and $$Δ$$G bind = -7.8 kcal/mol for the alternate PMF-based
  route. In detailing the underpinnings of these numerical strategies devised for
  the accurate determination of standard binding free energies, many practical elements
  of the proposed rigorous, conceptual framework are clarified, thereby paving way
  to tackle virtually any recognition and association phenomenon.
