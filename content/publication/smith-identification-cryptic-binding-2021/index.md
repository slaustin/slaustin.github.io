abstract: Protein dynamics play an important role in small molecule binding and can
  pose a significant challenge in the identification of potential binding sites. Cryptic
  binding sites have been defined as sites which require significant rearrangement
  of the protein structure to become physically accessible to a ligand. Mixed-solvent
  MD (MixMD) is a computational protocol which maps the surface of the protein using
  molecular dynamics (MD) of the unbound protein solvated in a 5% box of probe molecules
  with explicit water. This method has successfully identified known active and allosteric
  sites which did not require reorganization. In this study, we apply the MixMD protocol
  to identify known cryptic sites of 12 proteins characterized by a wide range of
  conformational changes. Of these 12 proteins, three require reorganization of side
  chains, five require loop movements, and four require movement of more significant
  structures such as whole helices. In five cases, we find that standard MixMD simulations
  are able to map the cryptic binding sites with at least one probe type. In two cases
  (guanylate kinase and TIE-2), accelerated MD, which increases sampling of torsional
  angles, was necessary to achieve mapping of portions of the cryptic binding site
  missed by standard MixMD. For more complex systems where movement of a helix or
  domain is necessary, MixMD was unable to map the binding site even with accelerated
  dynamics, possibly due to the limited timescale (100 ns for individual simulations).
  In general, similar conformational dynamics are observed in water-only simulations
  and those with probe molecules. This could imply that the probes are not driving
  opening events but rather take advantage of mapping sites that spontaneously open
  as part of their inherent conformational behavior. Finally, we show that docking
  to an ensemble of conformations from the standard MixMD simulations performs better
  than docking the apo crystal structure in nine cases and even better than half of
  the bound crystal structures. Poorer performance was seen in docking to ensembles
  of conformations from the accelerated MixMD simulations.
