 abstract = {With molecular dynamics protein dynamics can be simulated in atomic detail. Current computers are not fast enough to probe all available conformations, but fluctuations around one conformation can be sampled to a reasonable extent. The motions with the largest fluctuations can be filtered out of a simulation using covariance or principal component analysis. A problem with this analysis is that random diffusion can appear as correlated motion. An analysis is presented of how long a simulation should be to obtain relevant results for global motions. The analysis reveals that the cosine content of the principal components is a good indicator for bad sampling.},
