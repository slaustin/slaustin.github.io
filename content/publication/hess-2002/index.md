abstract: With molecular dynamics protein dynamics can be simulated in atomic detail.
  Current computers are not fast enough to probe all available conformations, but
  fluctuations around one conformation can be sampled to a reasonable extent. The
  motions with the largest fluctuations can be filtered out of a simulation using
  covariance or principal component analysis. A problem with this analysis is that
  random diffusion can appear as correlated motion. An analysis is presented of how
  long a simulation should be to obtain relevant results for global motions. The analysis
  reveals that the cosine content of the principal components is a good indicator
  for bad sampling.
