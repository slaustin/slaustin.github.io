abstract: 'Bacterial expression of $β$-lactamases is the most widespread resistance
  mechanism to $β$-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. There
  is a pressing need for novel, non-$β$-lactam inhibitors of these enzymes. One previously
  discovered novel inhibitor of the $β$-lactamase AmpC, compound 1, has several favorable
  properties: it is chemically dissimilar to $β$-lactams and is a noncovalent, competitive
  inhibitor of the enzyme. However, at 26 $μ$M its activity is modest. Using the X-ray
  structure of the AmpC/1 complex as a template, 14 analogues were designed and synthesized.
  The most active of these, compound 10, had a K i  of 1 $μ$M, 26-fold better than
  the lead. To understand the origins of this improved activity, the structures of
  AmpC in complex with compound 10 and an analogue, compound 11, were determined by
  X-ray crystallography to 1.97 and 1.96 Å, respectively. Compound 10 was active in
  cell culture, reversing resistance to the third generation cephalosporin ceftazidime
  in bacterial pathogens expressing AmpC. In contrast to $β$-lactam-based inhibitors
  clavulanate and cefoxitin, compound 10 did not up-regulate $β$-lactamase expression
  in cell culture but simply inhibited the enzyme expressed by the resistant bacteria.
  Its escape from this resistance mechanism derives from its dissimilarity to $β$-lactam
  antibiotics. o̧pyright 2005 American Chemical Society.'
