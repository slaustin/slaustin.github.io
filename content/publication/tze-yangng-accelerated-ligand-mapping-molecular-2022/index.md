abstract: The identification and characterization of binding sites is a critical component
  of structure-based drug design (SBDD). Probe-based/cosolvent molecular dynamics
  (MD) methods that allow for protein flexibility have been developed to predict ligand
  binding sites. However, cryptic pockets that appear only upon ligand binding and
  occluded binding sites with no access to the solvent pose significant challenges
  to these methods. Here, we report the development of accelerated ligand-mapping
  MD (aLMMD), which combines accelerated MD with LMMD, for the detection of these
  challenging binding sites. The method was validated on five proteins with what we
  term ``recalcitrant'' cryptic pockets, which are deeply buried pockets that require
  extensive movement of the protein backbone to expose, and three proteins with occluded
  binding sites. In all the cases, aLMMD was able to detect and sample the binding
  sites. Our results suggest that aLMMD could be used as a general approach for the
  detection of such elusive binding sites in protein targets, thus providing valuable
  information for SBDD.
