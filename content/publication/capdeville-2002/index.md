abstract: In the early 1980s, it became apparent that the work of pioneers such as
  Robert Weinberg, Mariano Barbacid and many others in identifying cancer-causing
  genes in humans was opening the door to a new era in anticancer research. Motivated
  by this, and by dissatisfaction with the limited efficacy and tolerability of available
  anticancer modalities, a drug discovery programme was initiated with the aim of
  rationally developing targeted anticancer therapies. Here, we describe how this
  programme led to the discovery and continuing development of Glivec (Gleevec in
  the United States), the first selective tyrosine-kinase inhibitor to be approved
  for the treatment of a cancer.
