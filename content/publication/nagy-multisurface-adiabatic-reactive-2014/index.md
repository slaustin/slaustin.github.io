abstract: Adiabatic reactive molecular dynamics (ARMD) simulation method is a surface-crossing
  algorithm for modeling chemical reactions in classical molecular dynamics simulations
  using empirical force fields. As the ARMD Hamiltonian is time dependent during crossing,
  it allows only approximate energy conservation. In the current work, the range of
  applicability of conventional ARMD is explored, and a new multisurface ARMD (MS-ARMD)
  method is presented, implemented in CHARMM and applied to the vibrationally induced
  photodissociation of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in the gas phase. For this, an accurate
  global potential energy surface (PES) involving 12 H2SO4 and 4 H2O + SO3 force fields
  fitted to MP2/6-311G++(2d,2p) reference energies is employed. The MS-ARMD simulations
  conserve total energy and feature both intramolecular H-transfer reactions and water
  elimination. An analytical treatment of the dynamics in the crossing region finds
  that conventional ARMD can approximately conserve total energy for limiting cases.
  In one of them, the reduced mass of the system is large, which often occurs for
  simulations of solvated biomolecular systems. On the other hand, MS-ARMD is a general
  approach for modeling chemical reactions including gas-phase, homogeneous, heterogeneous,
  and enzymatic catalytic reactions while conserving total energy in atomistic simulations.
