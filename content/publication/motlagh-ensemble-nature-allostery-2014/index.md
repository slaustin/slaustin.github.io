abstract: Allostery is the process by which biological macromolecules transmit the
  effect of binding at one site to another, often distal, functional site, allowing
  for the regulation of activity; here facilitation of allostery through dynamic and
  intrinsically disordered proteins is discussed, and a framework to unify the description
  of allosteric mechanisms for different systems is proposed.
