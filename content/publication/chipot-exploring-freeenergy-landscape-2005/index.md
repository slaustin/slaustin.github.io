abstract: The reversible folding of deca-alanine is chosen as a test case for characterizing
  a method that uses an adaptive biasing force (ABF) to escape from the minima and
  overcome the barriers of the free-energy landscape. This approach relies on the
  continuous estimation of a biasing force that yields a Hamiltonian in which no average
  force is exerted along the ordering parameter $ξ$. Optimizing the parameters that
  control how the ABF is applied, the method is shown to be extremely effective when
  a nonequivocal ordering parameter can be defined to explore the folding pathway
  of the peptide. Starting from a $β$-turn motif and restraining $ξ$ to a region of
  the conformational space that extends from the $α$-helical state to an ensemble
  of extended structures, the ABF scheme is successful in folding the peptide chain
  into a compact $α$ helix. Sampling of this conformation is, however, marginal when
  the range of $ξ$ values embraces arrangements of greater compactness, hence demonstrating
  the inherent limitations of free-energy methods when ambiguous ordering parameters
  are utilized.
