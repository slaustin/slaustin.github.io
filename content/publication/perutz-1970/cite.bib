 abstract = {The oxygenation of haemoglobin is accompanied by structural changes in the subunits triggered by shifts of the iron atoms relative to the porphyrin and, in the $β$-subunits, also by the steric effect of oxygen itself. The oxygen-free form is constrained by salt-bridges which are broken by the energy of haem-haem interaction with the release of H+. 2,3- Diphosphoglycerate may add to the constraints by being stereochemically complementary to a site between the $β$-chains ; this complementarity is lost on oxygenation. o̧pyright 1970 Nature Publishing Group.},
