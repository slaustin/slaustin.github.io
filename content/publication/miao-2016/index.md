abstract: Design of ligands that provide receptor selectivity has emerged as a new
  paradigm for drug discovery of G protein-coupled receptors, and may, for certain
  families of receptors, only be achieved via identification of chemically diverse
  allosteric modulators. Here, the extracellular vestibule of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptor (mAChR) is targeted for structure-based design of allosteric modulators.
  Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations were performed to construct structural
  ensembles that account for the receptor flexibility. Compounds obtained from the
  National Cancer Institute (NCI) were docked to the receptor ensembles. Retrospective
  docking of known ligands showed that combining aMD simulations with Glide induced
  fit docking (IFD) provided much-improved enrichment factors, compared with the Glide
  virtual screening workflow. Glide IFD was thus applied in receptor ensemble docking,
  and 38 top-ranked NCI compounds were selected for experimental testing. In [3H]N-methylscopolamine
  radioligand dissociation assays, approximately half of the 38 lead compounds altered
  the radioligand dissociation rate, a hallmark of allosteric behavior. In further
  competition binding experiments, we identified 12 compounds with affinity of $łeq$30
  $μ$M. With final functional experiments on six selected compounds, we confirmed
  four of them as new negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) and one as positive allosteric
  modulatorofagonist-mediated response at the M2 mAChR. Two of the NAMs showed subtype
  selectivity without significant effect at the M1 and M3 mAChRs. This study demonstrates
  an unprecedented successful structure-based approach to identify chemically diverse
  and selective GPCR allosteric modulators with outstanding potential for further
  structure-activity relationship studies.
