abstract: A first-principles molecular dynamics study is presented for the structural,
  dynamical, vibrational, and dipolar properties of the solvation shell of a nitrate
  ion in deuterated water. A detailed description of the anisotropic structure of
  the solvation shell is presented through calculations of various structural distributions
  in different conical shells around the perpendicular axis of the ion. The nitrate
  ion--water dimer potential energies are also calculated for many different orientations
  of water. The average vibrational stretch frequency of OD modes in the solvation
  shell is found to be higher than that of other OD modes in the bulk, which signifies
  a weakening of hydrogen bonds in the hydration shell. A splitting of the NO stretch
  frequencies and an associated fast spectral diffusion of the solute are also observed
  in the current study. The dynamics of rotation and hydrogen bond relaxation are
  found to be faster in the hydration shell than that in the bulk water. The residence
  time of water in the...
