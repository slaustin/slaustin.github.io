abstract: We report experimental and theoretical studies on water and protein dynamics
  following photoexcitation of apomyoglobin. Using site-directed mutation and with
  femtosecond resolution, we experimentally observed relaxation dynamics with a biphasic
  distribution of time scales, 5 and 87 ps, around the site Trp7. Theoretical studies
  using both linear response and direct nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) calculations
  reproduced the biphasic behavior. Further constrained MD simulations with either
  frozen protein or frozen water revealed the molecular mechanism of slow hydration
  processes and elucidated the role of protein fluctuations. Observation of slow water
  dynamics in MD simulations requires protein flexibility, regardless of whether the
  slow Stokes shift component results from the water or protein contribution. The
  initial dynamics in a few picoseconds represents fast local motions such as reorientations
  and translations of hydrating water molecules, followed by slow relaxation involving
  strongly coupled water-protein motions. We observed a transition from one isomeric
  protein configuration to another after 10 ns during our 30 ns ground-state simulation.
  For one isomer, the surface hydration energy dominates the slow component of the
  total relaxation energy. For the other isomer, the slow component is dominated by
  protein interactions with the chromophore. In both cases, coupled water-protein
  motion is shown to be necessary for observation of the slow dynamics. Such biologically
  important water-protein motions occur on tens of picoseconds. One significant discrepancy
  exists between theory and experiment, the large inertial relaxation predicted by
  simulations but clearly absent in experiment. Further improvements required in the
  theoretical model are discussed.
