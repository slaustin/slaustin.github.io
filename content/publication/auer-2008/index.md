abstract: IR and Raman (parallel- and perpendicular-polarized) spectra in the OH stretch
  region for liquid water were measured some years ago, but their interpretation is
  still controversial. In part, this is because theoretical calculation of such spectra
  for a neat liquid presents a formidable challenge due to the coupling between vibrational
  chromophores and the effects of motional narrowing. Recently we proposed an electronic
  structure/molecular dynamics method for calculating spectra of dilute HOD in liquid
  D(2)O, which relied on ab initio calculations on clusters to provide a map from
  nuclear coordinates of the molecules in the liquid to OH stretch frequencies, transition
  dipoles, and polarizabilities. Here we extend this approach to the calculation of
  couplings between chromophores. From the trajectories of the fluctuating local-mode
  frequencies, transition moments, and couplings, we use our recently developed time-averaging
  approximation to calculate the line shapes. Our results are in good agreement with
  experiment for the IR and Raman line shapes, and capture the significant differences
  among them. Our analysis shows that while the coupling between chromophores is relatively
  modest, it nevertheless produces delocalization of the vibrational eigenstates over
  up to 12 chromophores, which has a profound effect on the spectroscopy. In particular,
  our results demonstrate that the peak in the parallel-polarized Raman spectrum at
  about 3250 wavenumbers is collective in nature.
