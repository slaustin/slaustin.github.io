abstract: In aqueous solution, solute conformational transitions are governed by intimate
  interplays of the fluctuations of solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water interactions.
  To promote molecular fluctuations to enhance sampling of essential conformational
  changes, a common strategy is to construct an expanded Hamiltonian through a series
  of Hamiltonian perturbations and thereby broaden the distribution of certain interactions
  of focus. Due to a lack of active sampling of configuration response to Hamiltonian
  transitions, it is challenging for common expanded Hamil-tonian methods to robustly
  explore solvent mediated rare conformational events. The orthogonal space sampling
  (OSS) scheme, as exemplified by the orthogonal space random walk and orthogonal
  space tempering methods, provides a general framework for synchronous acceleration
  of slow configuration responses. To more effectively sample conformational transitions
  in aqueous solution, in this work, we devised a generalized orthogonal space tempering
  (gOST) algorithm. Specifically, in the Hamiltonian perturbation part, a solvent-accessible-surface-area-dependent
  term is introduced to implicitly perturb near-solute water-water fluctuations; more
  importantly in the orthogonal space response part, the generalized force order parameter
  is generalized as a two-dimension order parameter set, in which essential solute-solvent
  and solute-solute components are separately treated. The gOST algorithm is evaluated
  through a molecular dynamics simulation study on the explicitly solvated deca-alanine
  (Ala 10) peptide. On the basis of a fully automated sampling protocol, the gOST
  simulation enabled repetitive folding and unfolding of the solvated peptide within
  a single continuous trajectory and allowed for detailed constructions of Ala 10
  folding/unfolding free energy surfaces. The gOST result reveals that solvent cooperative
  fluctuations play a pivotal role in Ala 10 folding/unfolding transitions. In addition,
  our assessment analysis suggests that because essential conformational events are
  mainly driven by the compensating fluctuations of essential solute-solvent and solute-solute
  interactions, commonly employed \" predictive \" sampling methods are unlikely to
  be effective on this seemingly \" simple \" system. The gOST development presented
  in this paper illustrates how to employ the OSS scheme for physics-based sampling
  method designs.
