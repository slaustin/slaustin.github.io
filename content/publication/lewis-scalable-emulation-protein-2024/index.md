abstract: Following the sequence and structure revolutions, predicting the dynamical
  mechanisms of proteins that implement biological function remains an outstanding
  scientific challenge. Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD)
  simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations
  and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular
  Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands
  of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour
  on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and
  vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental
  protein stabilities, BioEmu's protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range
  of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many
  functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic
  pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements.
  Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors
  around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and
  experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural
  ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such
  as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable
  hypotheses.
