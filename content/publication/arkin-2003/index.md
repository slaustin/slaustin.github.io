abstract: 'Understanding binding properties at protein-protein interfaces has been
  limited to structural and mutational analyses of natural binding partners or small
  peptides identified by phage display. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis
  of a nonpeptidyl small molecule, previously discovered by medicinal chemistry [Tilley,
  J. W., et al. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 7589-7590], which binds to the cytokine
  IL-2. The small molecule binds to the same site that binds the IL-2 $Î±$ receptor
  and buries into a groove not seen in the free structure of IL-2. Comparison of the
  bound and several free structures shows this site to be composed of two subsites:
  one is rigid, and the other is highly adaptive. Thermodynamic data suggest the energy
  barriers between these conformations are low. The subsites were dissected by using
  a site-directed screening method called tethering, in which small fragments were
  captured by disulfide interchange with cysteines introduced into IL-2 around these
  subsites. X-ray structures with the tethered fragments show that the subsite-binding
  interactions are similar to those observed with the original small molecule. Moreover,
  the adaptive subsite tethered many more compounds than did the rigid one. Thus,
  the adaptive nature of a protein-protein interface provides sites for small molecules
  to bind and underscores the challenge of applying structure-based design strategies
  that cannot accurately predict a dynamic protein surface.'
