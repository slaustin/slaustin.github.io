abstract: We introduce an enhanced sampling algorithm to obtain converged free energy
  landscapes of molecular rare events, even when the collective variable (CV) used
  for biasing is not optimal. Our approach samples a time-dependent target distribution
  by combining the on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling and its exploratory variant,
  OPES Explore. This promotes more transitions between the relevant metastable states
  and accelerates the convergence speed of the free energy estimate. We demonstrate
  the successful application of this combined algorithm on the two-dimensional Wolfe--Quapp
  potential, millisecond time-scale ligand--receptor binding in the trypsin--benzamidine
  complex, and folding--unfolding transitions in chignolin mini-protein. Our proposed
  algorithm can compute accurate free energies at an affordable computational cost
  and is robust in terms of the choice of CVs, making it particularly promising for
  the simulation of complex biomolecular systems.
