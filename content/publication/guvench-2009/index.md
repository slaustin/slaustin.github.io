abstract: 'Fragment-based drug discovery using NMR and x-ray crystallographic methods
  has proven utility but also non-trivial time, materials, and labor costs. Current
  computational fragment-based approaches circumvent these issues but suffer from
  limited representations of protein flexibility and solvation effects, leading to
  difficulties with rigorous ranking of fragment affinities. To overcome these limitations
  we describe an explicit solvent all-atom molecular dynamics methodology (SILCS:
  Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation) that uses small aliphatic
  and aromatic molecules plus water molecules to map the affinity pattern of a protein
  for hydrophobic groups, aromatic groups, hydrogen bond donors, and hydrogen bond
  acceptors. By simultaneously incorporating ligands representative of all these functionalities,
  the method is an in silico free energy-based competition assay that generates three-dimensional
  probability maps of fragment binding (FragMaps) indicating favorable fragment:protein
  interactions. Applied to the two-fold symmetric oncoprotein BCL-6, the SILCS method
  yields two-fold symmetric FragMaps that recapitulate the crystallographic binding
  modes of the SMRT and BCOR peptides. These FragMaps account both for important sequence
  and structure differences in the C-terminal halves of the two peptides and also
  the high mobility of the BCL-6 His116 sidechain in the peptide-binding groove. Such
  SILCS FragMaps can be used to qualitatively inform the design of small-molecule
  inhibitors or as scoring grids for high-throughput in silico docking that incorporate
  both an atomic-level description of solvation and protein flexibility. oÌ§pyright
