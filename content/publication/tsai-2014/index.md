abstract: "The question of how allostery works was posed almost 50 years ago. Since
  then it has been the focus of much effort. This is for two reasons: first, the intellectual
  curiosity of basic science and the desire to understand fundamental phenomena, and
  second, its vast practical importance. Allostery is at play in all processes in
  the living cell, and increasingly in drug discovery. Many models have been successfully
  formulated, and are able to describe allostery even in the absence of a detailed
  structural mechanism. However, conceptual schemes designed to qualitatively explain
  allosteric mechanisms usually lack a quantitative mathematical model, and are unable
  to link its thermodynamic and structural foundations. This hampers insight into
  oncogenic mutations in cancer progression and biased agonists' actions. Here, we
  describe how allostery works from three different standpoints: thermodynamics, free
  energy landscape of population shift, and structure; all with exactly the same allosteric
  descriptors. This results in a unified view which not only clarifies the elusive
  allosteric mechanism but also provides structural grasp of agonist-mediated signaling
  pathways, and guides allosteric drug discovery. Of note, the unified view reasons
  that allosteric coupling (or communication) does not determine the allosteric efficacy;
  however, a communication channel is what makes potential binding sites allosteric."
