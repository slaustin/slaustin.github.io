abstract: 'After photodissociation, ligand rebinding to myoglobin exhibits complex
  kinetic patterns associated with multiple first-order geminate recombination processes
  occurring within the protein and a simpler bimolecular phase representing second-order
  ligand rebinding from the solvent. A smooth transition from cryogenic-like to solution
  phase properties can be obtained by using a combination of sol-gel encapsulation,
  addition of glycerol as a bathing medium, and temperature tuning (-15 --$>$ 65 degrees
  C). This approach was applied to a series of double mutants, myoglobin CO (H64L/V68X,
  where X = Ala, Val, Leu, Asn, and Phe), which were designed to examine the contributions
  of the position 68(E11) side chain to the appearance and disappearance of internal
  rebinding phases in the absence of steric and polar interactions with the distal
  histidine. Based on the effects of viscosity, temperature, and the stereochemistry
  of the E11 side chain, the three major phases, B --$>$ A, C --$>$ A, and D --$>$
  A, can be assigned, respectively, to ligand rebinding from the following: (i) the
  distal heme pocket, (ii) the xenon cavities prior to large amplitude side chain
  conformational relaxation, and (iii) the xenon cavities after significant conformational
  relaxation of the position 68(E11) side chain. The relative amplitudes of the B
  --$>$ A and C --$>$ A phases depend markedly on the size and shape of the E11 side
  chain, which regulates sterically both ligand return to the heme iron atom and ligand
  migration to the xenon cavities. The internal xenon cavities provide a transient
  docking site that allows side chain relaxations and the entry of water into the
  vacated distal pocket, which in turn slows ligand recombination markedly.'
