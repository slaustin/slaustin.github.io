 abstract = {The complexes of the fluorescence probe coumarin 153 with apomyoglobin and apoleghemoglobin are used as model systems to study solvation dynamics in proteins. Time-resolved Stokes shift experiments are compared with molecular dynamics simulations, and very good agreement is obtained. The solvation of the coumarin probe is very rapid with approximately 60% occurring within 300 fs and is attributed to interactions with water (or possibly to the protein itself). Differences in the solvation relaxation (or correlation) function C(t) for the two proteins are attributed to differences in their hemepockets.},
