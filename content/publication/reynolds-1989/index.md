abstract: A computational procedure is described for investigating potential binding
  sites of a target macromolecule for their ability to bind both a reduced probe molecule
  and an oxidized probe molecule. The interaction energies are obtained using a molecular
  mechanics method and can be displayed as three-dimensional (3D) energy contours,
  indicating regions of the target molecule that may have favorable interactions with
  the probe molecule. Differences in the interaction energies of the oxidized and
  reduced probe with the target can also be plotted as contours, indicating regions
  that are selective for the reduced probe. These selectivity contours can be used
  to show whether the macromolecule is a potential target for bioreductive agents.
  The method has been applied to the chicken liver dihydrofolate reductase enzyme
  and has indicated new binding regions that may be suitable binding sites for bioreductive
  agents. oÌ§pyright 1989 Butterworth Publishers.
