abstract: Allosteric drug development holds promise for delivering medicines that
  are more selective and less toxic than those that target orthosteric sites. To date,
  the discovery of allosteric binding sites and lead compounds has been mostly serendipitous,
  achieved through high-throughput screening. Over the past decade, structural data
  has become more readily available for larger protein systems and more membrane protein
  classes (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels), which are common allosteric drug targets.
  In parallel, improved simulation methods now provide better atomistic understanding
  of the protein dynamics and cooperative motions that are critical to allosteric
  mechanisms. As a result of these advances, the field of predictive allosteric drug
  development is now on the cusp of a new era of rational structure-based computational
  methods. Here, we review algorithms that predict allosteric sites based on sequence
  data and molecular dynamics simulations, describe tools that assess the druggability
  of these pockets, ...
