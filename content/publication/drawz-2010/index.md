abstract: Since the introduction of penicillin, beta-lactam antibiotics have been
  the antimicrobial agents of choice. Unfortunately, the efficacy of these life-saving
  antibiotics is significantly threatened by bacterial beta-lactamases. beta-Lactamases
  are now responsible for resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins,
  monobactams, and carbapenems. In order to overcome beta-lactamase-mediated resistance,
  beta-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam) were introduced
  into clinical practice. These inhibitors greatly enhance the efficacy of their partner
  beta-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin) in the treatment
  of serious Enterobacteriaceae and penicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections.
  However, selective pressure from excess antibiotic use accelerated the emergence
  of resistance to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Furthermore,
  the prevalence of clinically relevant beta-lactamases from other classes that are
  resistant to inhibition is rapidly increasing. There is an urgent need for effective
  inhibitors that can restore the activity of beta-lactams. Here, we review the catalytic
  mechanisms of each beta-lactamase class. We then discuss approaches for circumventing
  beta-lactamase-mediated resistance, including properties and characteristics of
  mechanism-based inactivators. We next highlight the mechanisms of action and salient
  clinical and microbiological features of beta-lactamase inhibitors. We also emphasize
  their therapeutic applications. We close by focusing on novel compounds and the
  chemical features of these agents that may contribute to a \"second generation\"
  of inhibitors. The goal for the next 3 decades will be to design inhibitors that
  will be effective for more than a single class of beta-lactamases
