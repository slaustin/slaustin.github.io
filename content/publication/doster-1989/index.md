abstract: Structural fluctuations in proteins on the picosecond timescale have been
  studied in considerable detail by theoretical methods such as molecular dynamics
  simulation1,2, but there exist very few experimental data with which to test the
  conclusions. We have used the technique of inelastic neutron scattering to investigate
  atomic motion in hydrated myoglobin over the temperature range 4-350 K and on the
  molecular dynamics timescale 0.1-100 ps. At temperatures below 180 K myglobin behaves
  as a harmonic solid, with essentially only vibrational motion. Above 180 K there
  is a striking dynamic transition arising from the excitation of nonvibrational motion,
  which we interpret as corresponding to torsional jumps between states of different
  energy, with a mean energy asymmetry of kJ mol-1. This extra mobility is reflected
  in a strong temperature dependence of the mean-square atomic displacements, a phenomenon
  previously observed specifically for the heme iron by Mössbauer spectroscopy3-5,
  but on a much slower timescale (10-7 s). It also correlates with a glass-like transition
  in the hydration shell of myoglobin6 and with the temperature-dependence of ligand-binding
  rates at the heme iron, as monitored by flash photolysis7. In contrast, the crystal
  structure of myoglobin determined down to 80 K shows no significant structural transition8-10.
  The dynamical behaviour we find for myoglobin (and other globular proteins) suggests
  a coupling of fast local motions to slower collective motions, which is a characteristic
  feature of other dense glass-forming systems. o̧pyright 1989 Nature Publishing Group.
