 abstract = {Free energy calculations are fundamental to obtaining accurate theoretical estimates of many important biological phenomena including hydration energies, protein-ligand binding affinities and energetics of conformational changes. Unlike traditional free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, $łambda$-dynamics treats the conventional ``$łambda$'' as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations and simultaneously evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the theory of $łambda$-dynamics, including the use of biasing and restraining potentials to facilitate conformational sampling. We review how $łambda$-dynamics has been used to rapidly and reliably compute relative hydration free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands, to accurately identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon protein stability. Finally, we suggest how $łambda$-dynamics may be extended to facilitate modeling efforts in structure-based drug design. o̧pyright 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2009},
