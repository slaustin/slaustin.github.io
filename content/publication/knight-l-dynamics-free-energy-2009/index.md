abstract: Free energy calculations are fundamental to obtaining accurate theoretical
  estimates of many important biological phenomena including hydration energies, protein-ligand
  binding affinities and energetics of conformational changes. Unlike traditional
  free energy perturbation and thermodynamic integration methods, $łambda$-dynamics
  treats the conventional ``$łambda$'' as a dynamic variable in free energy simulations
  and simultaneously evaluates thermodynamic properties for multiple states in a single
  simulation. In the present article, we provide an overview of the theory of $łambda$-dynamics,
  including the use of biasing and restraining potentials to facilitate conformational
  sampling. We review how $łambda$-dynamics has been used to rapidly and reliably
  compute relative hydration free energies and binding affinities for series of ligands,
  to accurately identify crystallographically observed binding modes starting from
  incorrect orientations, and to model the effects of mutations upon protein stability.
  Finally, we suggest how $łambda$-dynamics may be extended to facilitate modeling
  efforts in structure-based drug design. o̧pyright 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J
