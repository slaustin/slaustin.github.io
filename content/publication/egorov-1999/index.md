abstract: The accurate numerical calculation of general quantum time correlation functions
  for many-body systems is not possible at present. We discuss several schemes for
  obtaining approximate quantum time correlation functions using as input only the
  corresponding classical results, and assess the merits of each scheme by considering
  three exactly solvable model problems. We then turn to the problem of the vibrational
  energy relaxation of a high-frequency oscillator in a liquid, where the relaxation
  rate constant can be related to a certain quantum force-force time correlation function.
  Focusing specifically on the case of liquid oxygen, we calculate the classical force-force
  time correlation function using a molecular dynamics simulation and then determine
  various approximations to the relaxation rate constant by applying the schemes considered
  earlier. The Egelstaff scheme is found to lead to reasonable agreement with experiment.
