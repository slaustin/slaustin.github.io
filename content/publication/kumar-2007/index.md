abstract: X-ray and neutron diffractions, vibrational spectroscopy, and x-ray Raman
  scattering and absorption experiments on water are often interpreted in terms of
  hydrogen bonding. To this end a number of geometric definitions of hydrogen bonding
  in water have been developed. While all definitions of hydrogen bonding are to some
  extent arbitrary, those involving one distance and one angle for a given water dimer
  are unnecessarily so. In this paper the authors develop a systematic procedure based
  on two-dimensional potentials of mean force for defining cutoffs for a given pair
  of distance and angular coordinates. They also develop an electronic structure-based
  definition of hydrogen bonding in liquid water, related to the electronic occupancy
  of the antibonding OH orbitals. This definition turns out to be reasonably compatible
  with one of the distance-angle geometric definitions. These two definitions lead
  to an estimate of the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in liquid simple point
  charge/extended (SPC/E) water of between 3.2 and 3.4. They also used these and other
  hydrogen-bond definitions to examine the dynamics of local hydrogen-bond number
  fluctuations, finding an approximate long-time decay constant for SPC/E water of
  between 0.8 and 0.9 ps, which corresponds to the time scale for local structural
  relaxation.
