abstract: The design and preliminary SAR of a new series of 1H-quinazolin-4-one (QAZ)
  allosteric HCV NS5B thumb pocket 2 (TP-2) inhibitors was recently reported. To support
  optimization efforts, a molecular dynamics (MD) based modeling workflow was implemented,
  providing information on QAZ binding interactions with NS5B. This approach predicted
  a small but critical ligand-binding induced movement of a protein backbone region
  which increases the pocket size and improves access to the backbone carbonyl groups
  of Val 494 and Pro 495. This localized backbone shift was consistent with key SAR
  results and was subsequently confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The MD protocol
  guided the design of inhibitors, exploiting novel H-bond interactions with the two
  backbone carbonyl groups, leading to the first thumb pocket 2 NS5B inhibitor with
  picomolar antiviral potency in genotype (gt) 1a and 1b replicons (EC50 = 120 and
  110 pM, respectively) and with EC50 $łeq$ 80 nM against gt 2-6. o̧pyright 2013 American
