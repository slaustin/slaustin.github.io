abstract: The BCL6 transcriptional repressor is the most frequently involved oncogene
  in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We combined computer-aided drug design
  with functional assays to identify low-molecular-weight compounds that bind to the
  corepressor binding groove of the BCL6 BTB domain. One such compound disrupted BCL6/corepressor
  complexes in~vitro and in~vivo, and was observed by X-ray crystallography and NMR
  to bind the critical site within the BTB groove. This compound could induce expression
  of BCL6 target genes and kill BCL6-positive DLBCL cell lines. In xenotransplantation
  experiments, the compound was nontoxic and potently suppressed DLBCL tumors in~vivo.
  The compound also killed primary DLBCLs from human patients. o̧pyright 2010 Elsevier
