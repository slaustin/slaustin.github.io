abstract: A computational approach based on Delaunay triangulation is presented to
  identify internal water molecules in proteins and to capture pathways of exchange
  with the bulk. The implemented procedure is computationally efficient and can easily
  be applied to long molecular dynamics trajectories of protein simulations. In an
  application to fatty acid-binding protein in apo-form and with bound palmitate,
  several protein orifices known from crystal structures have been confirmed to be
  major portals of solvent exchange. Differences between the two forms of the protein
  are observed and discussed. oÌ§pyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
