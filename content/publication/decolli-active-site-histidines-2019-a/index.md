abstract: The product of 1-deoxy-d-xyluose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase, DXP, feeds
  into the bacterial biosynthesis of isoprenoids, thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), and
  pyridoxal phosphate. DXP is essential for human pathogens but not utilized by humans;
  thus, DXP synthase is an attractive anti-infective target. The unique ThDP-dependent
  mechanism and structure of DXP synthase offer ideal opportunities for selective
  targeting. Upon reaction with pyruvate, DXP synthase uniquely stabilizes the predecarboxylation
  intermediate, C2$Î±$-lactylThDP (LThDP), in a closed conformation. Subsequent binding
  of d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate induces an open conformation that is proposed to
  destabilize LThDP, triggering decarboxylation. Evidence for the closed and open
  conformations has been revealed by hydrogen--deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
  and X-ray crystallography, which indicate that H49 and H299 are involved in conformational
  dynamics and movement of the fork and spoon motifs away from the active site is
  important for the closed-to-open transition. Interestingly, H49 and H299 are critical
  for DXP formation and interact with the predecarboxylation intermediate in the closed
  conformation. H299 is removed from the active site in the open conformation of the
  postdecarboxylation state. In this study, we show that substitution at H49 and H299
  negatively impacts LThDP formation by shifting the conformational equilibrium of
  DXP synthase toward an open conformation. We also present a method for monitoring
  the dynamics of the spoon motif that uncovered a previously undetected role for
  H49 in coordinating the closed conformation. Overall, our results suggest that H49
  and H299 are critical for the closed, predecarboxylation state providing the first
  direct link between catalysis and conformational dynamics.
