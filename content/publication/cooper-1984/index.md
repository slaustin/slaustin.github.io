abstract: A general model is presented whereby lignand-induced changes in protein
  dynamics could produce allosteric communication between distinct binding sites,
  even in the absence of a macromolecular conformational change. Theoretical analysis,
  based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative
  interaction free energies amounting to several kJ $·$ mol-1 may be generated by
  this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes
  of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can
  involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency
  normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or
  groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive
  approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real
  systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes
  in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence
  of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism.
  We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to
  take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the
  inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean. o̧pyright 1984 Springer-Verlag.
