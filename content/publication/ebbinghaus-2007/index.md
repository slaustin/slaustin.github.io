abstract: 'The focus in protein folding has been very much on the protein backbone
  and sidechains. However, hydration waters make comparable contributions to the structure
  and energy of proteins. The coupling between fast hydration dynamics and protein
  dynamics is considered to play an important role in protein folding. Fundamental
  questions of protein hydration include, how far out into the solvent does the influence
  of the biomolecule reach, how is the water affected, and how are the properties
  of the hydration water influenced by the separation between protein molecules in
  solution? We show here that Terahertz spectroscopy directly probes such solvation
  dynamics around proteins, and determines the width of the dynamical hydration layer.
  We also investigate the dependence of solvation dynamics on protein concentration.
  We observe an unexpected nonmonotonic trend in the measured terahertz absorbance
  of the five helix bundle protein lambda(6-85)* as a function of the protein: water
  molar ratio. The trend can be explained by overlapping solvation layers around the
  proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate water dynamics in the solvation
  layer around one protein to be distinct from bulk water out to approximately 10
  A. At higher protein concentrations such that solvation layers overlap, the calculated
  absorption spectrum varies nonmonotonically, qualitatively consistent with the experimental
  observations. The experimental data suggest an influence on the correlated water
  network motion beyond 20 A, greater than the pure structural correlation length
  usually observed.'
