abstract: While being one of the most popular reaction rate theories, the applicability
  of transition state theory to the study of enzymatic reactions has been often challenged.
  The complex dynamic nature of the protein environment raised the question about
  the validity of the nonrecrossing hypothesis, a cornerstone in this theory. We present
  a computational strategy to quantify the error associated to transition state theory
  from the number of recrossings observed at the equicommittor, which is the best
  possible dividing surface. Application of a direct multidimensional transition state
  optimization to the hydride transfer step in human dihydrofolate reductase shows
  that both the participation of the protein degrees of freedom in the reaction coordinate
  and the error associated to the nonrecrossing hypothesis are small. Thus, the use
  of transition state theory, even with simplified reaction coordinates, provides
  a good theoretical framework for the study of enzymatic catalysis.
