abstract: Enzymes exist as ensembles of conformations that are important for function.
  Tuning these populations of conformational states through mutation enables evolution
  toward additional activities. Here we computationally evaluate the population shifts
  induced by distal and active site mutations in a family of computationally designed
  and experimentally optimized retro-aldolases. The conformational landscape of these
  enzymes was significantly altered during evolution, as pre-existing catalytically
  active conformational substates became major states in the most evolved variants.
  We further demonstrate that key residues responsible for these substate conversions
  can be predicted computationally. Significantly, the identified residues coincide
  with those positions mutated in the laboratory evolution experiments. This study
  establishes that distal mutations that affect enzyme catalytic activity can be predicted
  computationally and thus provides the enzyme (re)design field with a rational strategy
  to determine promising sites for enhancing activity through mutation.
