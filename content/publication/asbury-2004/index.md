abstract: The dynamics of water are examined using ultrafast IR stimulated vibrational
  echo correlation spectroscopy. The OD hydroxyl stretch of HOD in H2O is probed with
  45-fs pulses that have sufficient bandwidth ($>$400 cm-1) to span the entire broad
  spectrum. High-quality 2D correlation spectra are obtained having the correct phase
  relations across the broad hydroxyl band. The correlation spectra are found to evolve
  on multiple time scales. The time evolution of the vibrational echo correlation
  spectrum reflects the structural evolution of the hydrogen bond networks. The extended
  vibrational lifetime of the OD hydroxyl stretch of HOD in H2O facilitates the measurement
  of hydrogen bond dynamics for longer times than possible in previous studies of
  the OH stretch. Molecular dynamics simulations/electronic structure calculations
  are used to obtain the time correlation functions (TCF) for two water models, TIP4P
  and SPC/E. The TCFs are inputs to full time-dependent diagrammatic perturbation
  theory calculations, which yield theoretical correlation spectra. Quantitative comparison
  with the data demonstrates that the two water models somewhat overemphasize the
  fast fluctuations in water and do not contain a slow enough component to account
  for the slowest fluctuations. Fits to the data using a phenomenological triexponential
  TCF yield a slowest component of ?2 ps, and TIP4P and SPC/E have slowest components
  of $<$1 ps. The TCF obtained from the water models and the triexponential TCF reproduce
  the linear absorption line shape equally well, but all miss to some extent the asymmetric
  ?wing? on the low-energy side of the line. Therefore, the time dependence of the
  vibrational echo correlation spectra provides a good test for the TCF, but the absorption
  spectrum does not.
