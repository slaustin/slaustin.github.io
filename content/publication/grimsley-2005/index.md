abstract: Organophosphorus hydrolase detoxifies a broad range of organophosphate pesticides
  and the chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sarin and VX. Previously, rational genetic
  engineering produced OPH variants with 30-fold enhancements in the hydrolysis of
  CWA and their analogs. One interesting variant (H254R) in which the histidine at
  position 254 was changed to an arginine showed a 4-fold increase in the hydrolysis
  of demetonS (VX analog), a 14-fold decrease with paraoxon (an insecticide), and
  a 183-fold decrease with DFP (sarin analog). The three-dimensional structure of
  this enzyme at 1.9 Å resolution with the inhibitor, diethyl 4-methylbenzylphosphonate
  (EBP), revealed that the inhibitor did not bind at the active site, but bound exclusively
  into a well-defined surface pocket 12 A away from the active site. This structural
  feature was accompanied by non-competitive inhibition of paraoxon hydrolysis by
  EBP with H254R, in contrast to the native enzyme, which showed competitive inhibition.
  These parallel structure-function characteristics identify a functional, allosteric
  site on the surface of this enzyme. o̧pyright 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
