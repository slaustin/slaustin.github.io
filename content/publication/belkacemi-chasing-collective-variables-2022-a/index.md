abstract: 'Free energy biasing methods have proven to be powerful tools to accelerate
  the simulation of important conformational changes of molecules by modifying the
  sampling measure. However, most of these methods rely on the prior knowledge of
  low-dimensional slow degrees of freedom, i.e., collective variables (CVs). Alternatively,
  such CVs can be identified using machine learning (ML) and dimensionality reduction
  algorithms. In this context, approaches where the CVs are learned in an iterative
  way using adaptive biasing have been proposed: at each iteration, the learned CV
  is used to perform free energy adaptive biasing to generate new data and learn a
  new CV. In this paper, we introduce a new iterative method involving CV learning
  with autoencoders: Free Energy Biasing and Iterative Learning with AutoEncoders
  (FEBILAE). Our method includes a reweighting scheme to ensure that the learning
  model optimizes the same loss at each iteration and achieves CV convergence. Using
  the alanine dipeptide system and the solvated chignolin mini-protein system as examples,
  we present results of our algorithm using the extended adaptive biasing force as
  the free energy adaptive biasing method.'
