abstract: The structure and function of biomolecules are strongly influenced by their
  hydration shells. Structural fluctuations and molecular excitations of hydrating
  water molecules cover a broad range in space and time, from individual water molecules
  to larger pools and from femtosecond to microsecond time scales. Recent progress
  in theory and molecular dynamics simulations as well as in ultrafast vibrational
  spectroscopy has led to new and detailed insight into fluctuations of water structure,
  elementary water motions, electric fields at hydrated biointerfaces, and processes
  of vibrational relaxation and energy dissipation. Here, we review recent advances
  in both theory and experiment, focusing on hydrated DNA, proteins, and phospholipids,
  and compare dynamics in the hydration shells to bulk water.
