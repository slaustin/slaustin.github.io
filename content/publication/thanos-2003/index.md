abstract: The complexes between IL-2 and two similar small molecules, one a lead compound
  and the other a potent, affinity-optimized compound, were determined by X-ray crystallography.
  The lead compound (IC50 = 6 $μ$M) bound to a hot spot on IL-2 in a groove that is
  not apparent in either the unliganded protein or a complex between IL-2 and a weakly
  bound drug fragment. The affinity-optimized compound (IC50 = 0.06 $μ$M), which has
  an added aromatic acid fragment, bound in the same groove as the lead compound.
  In addition, a novel binding site was formed for the aromatic acid which is unseen
  in the complex with the lead compound. Thus, the hot spot on IL-2 is highly dynamic,
  with the protein changing form at multiple sites to maximize packing for each compound.
  Binding-site rigidity is often thought to play a role in high-affinity interactions.
  However, in this case, specific contacts between the small molecule and the protein
  are made despite the adaptivity of the hot spot. Given the change in morphology
  that was observed in IL-2, it is unlikely that a potent inhibitor could have been
  found by rational design. Therefore, fragment assembly methods offer the stochastic
  advantage of finding fragments in flexible protein regions where structural changes
  are unpredictable. Copyright o̧pyright 2003 American Chemical Society.
