abstract: Clavulanate, an inhibitor for beta-lactamases, was the very first inhibitor
  for an antibiotic resistance enzyme that found clinical utility in 1985. The clinical
  use of clavulanate and that of sulbactam and tazobactam, which were introduced to
  the clinic subsequently, has facilitated evolution of a set of beta-lactamases that
  not only retain their original function as resistance enzymes but also are refractory
  to inhibition by the inhibitors. This article characterizes the properties of the
  clinically identified M69L mutant variant of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase from Escherichia
  coli, an inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamase, and compares it to the wild-type enzyme.
  The enzyme is as active as the wild-type in turnover of typical beta-lactam antibiotics.
  Furthermore, many of the parameters for interactions of the inhibitors with the
  mutant enzyme are largely unaffected. The significant effect of the inhibitor-resistant
  trait was a relatively modest elevation of the dissociation constant for the formation
  of the pre-acylation complex. The high-resolution X-ray crystal structure for the
  M69L mutant variant revealed essentially no alteration of the three-dimensional
  structure, both for the protein backbone and for the positions of the side chains
  of the amino acids. It was surmised that the difference in the two enzymes must
  reside with the dynamic motions of the two proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations
  of the mutant and wild-type proteins were carried out for 2 ns each. Dynamic cross-correlated
  maps revealed the collective motions of the two proteins to be very similar, yet
  the two proteins did not behave identically. Differences in behavior of the two
  proteins existed in the regions between residues 145-179 and 155-162. Additional
  calculations revealed that kinetic effects measured experimentally for the dissociation
  constant for the pre-acylation complex could be mostly attributed to the electrostatic
  and van der Waals components of the binding free energy. The effects of the mutation
  on the behavior of the beta-lactamase were subtle, including the differences in
  the measured dissociation constants that account for the inhibitor-resistant trait.
  It would appear that nature has selected for incorporation of the most benign alteration
  in the structure of the wild-type TEM-1 beta-lactamase that is sufficient to give
  the inhibitor-resistant trait.
