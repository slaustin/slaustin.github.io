abstract: Parkinson's disease, originating from the intrinsically disordered peptide
  $α$-synuclein, is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 5%
  of the population above age 85. It remains unclear how $α$-synuclein monomers undergo
  conformational changes leading to aggregation and formation of fibrils characteristic
  for the disease. In the present study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations
  (over 180 $μ$s in aggregated time) using a hybrid-resolution model, Proteins with
  Atomic details in Coarse-grained Environment (PACE), to characterize in atomic detail
  structural ensembles of wild type and mutant monomeric $α$-synuclein in aqueous
  solution. The simulations reproduce structural properties of $α$-synuclein characterized
  in experiments, such as secondary structure content, long-range contacts, chemical
  shifts, and 3J(HNHC$α$)-coupling constants. Most notably, the simulations reveal
  that a short fragment encompassing region 38-53, adjacent to the non-amyloid-$β$
  component region, exhibits a high probability of forming a $β$-hairpin; this fragment,
  when isolated from the remainder of $α$-synuclein, fluctuates frequently into its
  $β$-hairpin conformation. Two disease-prone mutations, namely, A30P and A53T, significantly
  accelerate the formation of a $β$-hairpin in the stated fragment. We conclude that
  the formation of a $β$-hairpin in region 38-53 is a key event during $α$-synuclein
  aggregation. We predict further that the G47V mutation impedes the formation of
  a turn in the $β$-hairpin and slows down $β$-hairpin formation, thereby retarding
  $α$-synuclein aggregation.
