 abstract = {The polarized Raman spectrum and the time dependence of the transient infrared (TRIR) absorption anisotropy are calculated for the OH stretching mode of liquid water (neat liquid H2O) by using time-domain formulations, which include the effects of both the diagonal frequency modulations (of individual oscillators) induced by the interactions between the dipole derivatives and the intermolecular electric field, and the off-diagonal (intermolecular) vibrational coupling described by the transition dipole coupling (TDC) mechanism. The IR spectrum of neat liquid H2O and the TRIR anisotropy of a liquid mixture of H2O/HDO/D2O are also calculated. It is shown that the calculated features of these optical signals, including the temperature dependence of the polarized Raman and IR spectra, are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results, indicating that the frequency separation between the isotropic and anisotropic components of the polarized Raman spectrum and the rapid decay (approximately 0.1 ps) of the TRIR anisotropy of the OH stretching mode of neat liquid H2O are mainly controlled by the resonant intermolecular vibrational coupling described by the TDC mechanism. Comparing with the time evolution of vibrational excitations, it is suggested that the TRIR anisotropy decays in the time needed for the initially localized vibrational excitations to delocalize over a few oscillators. It is also shown that the enhancement of the dipole derivatives by the interactions with surrounding molecules is an important factor in generating the spectral profiles of the OH stretching Raman band. The time-domain behavior of the molecular motions that affect the spectroscopic features is discussed.},
