abstract: Hydrogen-deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is
  a widely applied biophysical technique that probes the structure and dynamics of
  biomolecules without the need for site-directed modifications or bio-orthogonal
  labels. The mechanistic interpretation of HDX data, however, is often qualitative
  and subjective, owing to a lack of quantitative methods to rigorously translate
  observed deuteration levels into atomistic structural information. To help address
  this problem, we have developed a methodology to generate structural ensembles that
  faithfully reproduce HDX-MS measurements. In this approach, an ensemble of protein
  conformations is first generated, typically using molecular dynamics simulations.
  A maximum-entropy bias is then applied post hoc to the resulting ensemble such that
  averaged peptide-deuteration levels, as predicted by an empirical model, agree with
  target values within a given level of uncertainty. We evaluate this approach, referred
  to as HDX ensemble reweighting (HDXer), for artificial target data reflecting the
  two major conformational states of a binding protein. We demonstrate that the information
  provided by HDX-MS experiments and by the model of exchange are sufficient to recover
  correctly weighted structural ensembles from simulations, even when the relevant
  conformations are rarely observed. Degrading the information content of the target
  data---e.g., by reducing sequence coverage, by averaging exchange levels over longer
  peptide segments, or by incorporating different sources of uncertainty---reduces
  the structural accuracy of the reweighted ensemble but still allows for useful insights
  into the distinctive structural features reflected by the target data. Finally,
  we describe a quantitative metric to rank candidate structural ensembles according
  to their correspondence with target data and illustrate the use of HDXer to describe
  changes in the conformational ensemble of the membrane protein LeuT. In summary,
  HDXer is designed to facilitate objective structural interpretations of HDX-MS data
  and to inform experimental approaches and further developments of theoretical exchange
  models.
