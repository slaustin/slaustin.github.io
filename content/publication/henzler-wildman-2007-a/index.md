abstract: Because proteins are central to cellular function, researchers have sought
  to uncover the secrets of how these complex macromolecules execute such a fascinating
  variety of functions. Although static structures are known for many proteins, the
  functions of proteins are governed ultimately by their dynamic character (or 'personality').
  The dream is to 'watch' proteins in action in real time at atomic resolution. This
  requires addition of a fourth dimension, time, to structural biology so that the
  positions in space and time of all atoms in a protein can be described in detail.
