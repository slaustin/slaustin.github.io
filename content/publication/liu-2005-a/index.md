abstract: A novel class of 5-cyanopyrimidine-based inhibitors of p38a MAP kinase has
  been investigated. Analogues optimized through SAR iterations display low nanomolar
  enzymatic and cellular activity. The in vivo efficacy of this class of p38 inhibitors
  was demonstrated by 3a and 3b ($>$50% reduction in TNF levels when orally dosed
  at 5 mg/kg, 5 h prior to LPS administration in an acute murine model of inflammation).
  For 3a and 3b, the previously identified N-methoxybenzamide moiety (1) was replaced
  with N-(isoxazol-3-yl)benzamide, thereby providing increased metabolic stability.
  Cyanopyrimidine 3a demonstrated 100% oral bioavailability in mouse. High p38 kinase
  selectivity versus over 20 kinases was observed for analogue 3b. Direct hydrogen
  bonding of the cyano nitrogen of the 5-cyanopyrimidine core to the backbone NH of
  Met109 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis of 3a bound to p38$α$. o̧pyright
