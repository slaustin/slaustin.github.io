abstract: Quorum sensing (QS) controls certain behaviors of bacteria in response to
  population density. In Gram-negative bacteria, QS is often mediated by N-acyl-L-homoserine
  lactones (acyl-HSLs). Because QS influences the virulence of many pathogenic bacteria,
  synthetic inhibitors of acyl-HSL synthases might be useful therapeutically for controlling
  pathogens. However, rational design of a potent QS antagonist has been thwarted
  by the lack of information concerning the binding interactions between acyl-HSL
  synthases and their ligands. In the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia glumae,
  QS controls virulence, motility, and protein secretion and is mediated by the binding
  of N-octanoyl-L-HSL (C8-HSL) to its cognate receptor, TofR. C8-HSL is synthesized
  by the acyl-HSL synthase TofI. In this study, we characterized two previously unknown
  QS inhibitors identified in a focused library of acyl-HSL analogs. Our functional
  and X-ray crystal structure analyses show that the first inhibitor, J8-C8, binds
  to TofI, occupying the binding site for the acyl chain of the TofI cognate substrate,
  acylated acyl-carrier protein. Moreover, the reaction byproduct, 5$prime$-methylthioadenosine,
  independently binds to the binding site for a second substrate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine.
  Closer inspection of the mode of J8-C8 binding to TofI provides a likely molecular
  basis for the various substrate specificities of acyl-HSL synthases. The second
  inhibitor, E9C-3oxoC6, competitively inhibits C8-HSL binding to TofR. Our analysis
  of the binding of an inhibitor and a reaction byproduct to an acyl-HSL synthase
  may facilitate the design of a new class of QS-inhibiting therapeutic agents.
