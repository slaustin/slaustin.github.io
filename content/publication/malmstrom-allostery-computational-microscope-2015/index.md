abstract: Ligand-induced protein allostery plays a central role in modulating cellular
  signalling pathways. Here using the conserved cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of
  protein kinase A's (PKA) regulatory subunit as a prototype signalling unit, we combine
  long-timescale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models
  to elucidate the conformational ensembles of PKA's cyclic nucleotide-binding domain
  A for the cAMP-free (apo) and cAMP-bound states. We find that both systems exhibit
  shallow free-energy landscapes that link functional states through multiple transition
  pathways. This observation suggests conformational selection as the general mechanism
  of allostery in this canonical signalling domain. Further, we expose the propagation
  of the allosteric signal through key structural motifs in the cyclic nucleotide-binding
  domain and explore the role of kinetics in its function. Our approach integrates
  disparate lines of experimental data into one cohesive framework to understand structure,
  dynamics and function in complex biological systems.
