abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins reveal the existence of
  many transient surface pockets; however, the factors determining what small subset
  of these represent druggable or functionally relevant ligand binding sites, called
  ``cryptic sites,'' are not understood. Here, we examine multiple X-ray structures
  for a set of proteins with validated cryptic sites, using the computational hot
  spot identification tool FTMap. The results show that cryptic sites in ligand-free
  structures generally have a strong binding energy hot spot very close by. As expected,
  regions around cryptic sites exhibit above-average flexibility, and close to 50%
  of the proteins studied here have unbound structures that could accommodate the
  ligand without clashes. Nevertheless, the strong hot spot neighboring each cryptic
  site is almost always exploited by the bound ligand, suggesting that binding may
  frequently involve an induced fit component. We additionally evaluated the structural
  basis for cryptic site formation, by comparing unbound to bound structures. Cryptic
  sites are most frequently occluded in the unbound structure by intrusion of loops
  (22.5%), side chains (19.4%), or in some cases entire helices (5.4%), but motions
  that create sites that are too open can also eliminate pockets (19.4%). The flexibility
  of cryptic sites frequently leads to missing side chains or loops (12%) that are
  particularly evident in low resolution crystal structures. An interesting observation
  is that cryptic sites formed solely by the movement of side chains, or of backbone
  segments with fewer than five residues, result only in low affinity binding sites
  with limited use for drug discovery.
