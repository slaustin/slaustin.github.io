abstract: The Philadelphia chromosome, widely implicated in human leukaemia, is the
  result of a reciprocal translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11) in which the abl oncogene
  located at 9q34 is translocated to chromosome 22q11, where it is fused head-to-tail
  with 5$prime$ exons of the bcr gene1-8. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, some patients
  have a breakpoint within the major breakpoint cluster region of the bcr gene, whereas
  others have the break within its first intron6,9-13. This second type of translocation
  results in the transcription of a 7.0-kilobase chimaeric bcr/abl messenger RNA translated
  into a bcr/abl fusion protein, p190, which has an abnormal tyrosine kinase activity
  and is strongly autophosphorylated in vitro14. We have generated mice transgenic
  for a bcr/abl p190 DNA construct and find that progeny are either moribund with,
  or die of acute leukaemia (myeloid or lymphoid) 10-58 days after birth. This finding
  is evidence for a causal relationship between the Philadelphia chromosome and human
  leukaemia. oÌ§pyright 1990 Nature Publishing Group.
