abstract: 'Solute sampling of explicit bulk-phase aqueous environments in grand canonical
  (GC) ensemble simulations suffer from poor convergence due to low insertion probabilities
  of the solutes. To address this, we developed an iterative procedure involving Grand
  Canonical-like Monte Carlo (GCMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Each
  iteration involves GCMC of both the solutes and water followed by MD, with the excess
  chemical potential ($μ$ex) of both the solute and the water oscillated to attain
  their target concentrations in the simulation system. By periodically varying the
  $μ$ex of the water and solutes over the GCMC-MD iterations, solute exchange probabilities
  and the spatial distributions of the solutes improved. The utility of the oscillating-$μ$ex
  GCMC-MD method is indicated by its ability to approximate the hydration free energy
  (HFE) of the individual solutes in aqueous solution as well as in dilute aqueous
  mixtures of multiple solutes. For seven organic solutes: benzene, propane, acetaldehyde,
  methanol, formamide, acetate, and methylammonium, the average $μ$ex of the solutes
  and the water converged close to their respective HFEs in both 1 M standard state
  and dilute aqueous mixture systems. The oscillating-$μ$ex GCMC methodology is also
  able to drive solute sampling in proteins in aqueous environments as shown using
  the occluded binding pocket of the T4 lysozyme L99A mutant as a model system. The
  approach was shown to satisfactorily reproduce the free energy of binding of benzene
  as well as sample the functional group requirements of the occluded pocket consistent
  with the crystal structures of known ligands bound to the L99A mutant as well as
  their relative binding affinities.'
