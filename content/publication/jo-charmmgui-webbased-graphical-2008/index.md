abstract: CHARMM is an academic research program used widely for macromolecular mechanics
  and dynamics with versatile analysis and manipulation tools of atomic coordinates
  and dynamics trajectories. CHARMM-GUI, http://www.charmm-gui.org, has been developed
  to provide a web-based graphical user interface to generate various input files
  and molecular systems to facilitate and standardize the usage of common and advanced
  simulation techniques in CHARMM. The web environment provides an ideal platform
  to build and validate a molecular model system in an interactive fashion such that,
  if a problem is found through visual inspection, one can go back to the previous
  setup and regenerate the whole system again. In this article, we describe the currently
  available functional modules of CHARMM-GUI Input Generator that form a basis for
  the advanced simulation techniques. Future directions of the CHARMM-GUI development
  project are also discussed briefly together with other features in the CHARMM-GUI
  website, such as Archive and Movie Gallery. oÌ§pyright 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
