abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that,
  in some cases, has been linked with mutations to the antioxidant metalloenzyme superoxide
  dismutase (SOD1). Although the mature form of this enzyme is highly stable and resistant
  to aggregation, the most immature form, lacking metal and a stabilizing intrasubunit
  disulfide bond, apoSOD1(2SH), is dynamic and hypothesized to be a major cause of
  toxicity in vivo. Previous solution NMR studies of wild-type apoSOD1(2SH) have shown
  that the ground state interconverts with a series of sparsely populated and transiently
  formed conformers, some of which have aberrant nonnative structures. Here, we study
  seven disease mutants of apoSOD1(2SH) and characterize their free energy landscapes
  as a first step in understanding the initial stages of disease progression and,
  more generally, to evaluate the plasticity of low-lying protein conformational states.
  The mutations lead to little change in the structures and dynamics of the ground
  states of the mutant proteins. By contrast, the numbers of low-lying excited states
  that are accessible to each of the disease mutants can vary significantly, with
  additional conformers accessed in some cases. Our study suggests that the diversity
  of these structures can provide alternate interaction motifs for different mutants,
  establishing additional pathways for new and often aberrant intra- and intermolecular
  contacts. Further, it emphasizes the potential importance of conformationally excited
  states in directing both folding and misfolding processes.
