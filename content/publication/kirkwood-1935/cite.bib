 abstract = {Expressions for the chemical potentials of the components of gas mixtures and liquid solutions are obtained in terms of relatively simple integrals in the configuration spaces of molecular pairs. The molecular pair distribution functions appearing in these integrals are investigated in some detail, in their dependence upon the composition and density of the fluid. The equation of state of a real gas mixture is discussed, and an approximate molecular pair distribution function, typical of dense fluids, is calculated. Applications of the method to the theory of solutions will be the subject of a later article.},
