abstract: Experimental and computer simulation studies have revealed the presence
  of a glasslike transition in the internal dynamics of hydrated proteins at $âˆ¼$200
  K involving an increase of the amplitude of anharmonic dynamics. This increase in
  flexibility has been correlated with the onset of protein activity. Here, we determine
  the driving force behind the protein transition by performing molecular dynamics
  simulations of myoglobin surrounded by a shell of water. A dual heatbath method
  is used with which, in any given simulation, the protein and solvent are held at
  different temperatures, and sets of simulations are performed varying the temperature
  of the components. The results show that the protein transition is driven by a dynamical
  transition in the hydration water that induces increased fluctuations primarily
  in side chains in the external regions of the protein. The water transition involves
  activation of translational diffusion and occurs even in simulations where the protein
  atoms are held fixed.
