abstract: Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a
  known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational,
  orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial
  rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is
  followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential
  grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further
  refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is
  crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose
  uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms.
  Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes
  starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of
  the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than
  1 Å in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 Å in only about one-third
  of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly
  twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having
  up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently
  described Surflex method.
