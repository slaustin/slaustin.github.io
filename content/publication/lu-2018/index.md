abstract: Hidden allosteric sites, as a novel type of allosteric site, are invisible
  in ligand-unbound (apo) crystal structures, but can emerge in ligand-bound (holo)
  crystal structures when a specific ligand binds to, and stabilizes, a unique conformation
  favored by the ligand. However, the identification of these sites is a significant
  challenge. Several computational and experimental approaches have been developed
  to identify such sites in proteins. Here, we outline these approaches, with a focus
  on examples of the successful use of such techniques. The discovery of hidden allosteric
  sites offers a new avenue for facilitating drug design by greatly expanding the
  repertoire of available drug targets, contributing to the search for allosteric
  drugs for the treatment of human diseases.
