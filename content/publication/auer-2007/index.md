abstract: 'We present improvements on our previous approaches for calculating vibrational
  spectroscopy observables for the OH stretch region of dilute HOD in liquid D2O.
  These revised approaches are implemented to calculate IR and isotropic Raman spectra,
  using the SPC/E simulation model, and the results are in good agreement with experiment.
  We also calculate observables associated with three-pulse IR echoes: the peak shift
  and 2D-IR spectrum. The agreement with experiment for the former is improved over
  our previous calculations, but discrepancies between theory and experiment still
  exist. Using our proposed definition for hydrogen bonding in liquid water, we decompose
  the distribution of frequencies in the OH stretch region in terms of subensembles
  of HOD molecules with different local hydrogen-bonding environments. Such a decomposition
  allows us to make the connection with experiments and calculations on water clusters
  and more generally to understand the extent of the relationship between transition
  frequency and local structure in the liquid.'
