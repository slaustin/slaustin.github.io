abstract: Absolute entropies was calculated using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
  trajectories. The heuristic formula for the calculation of entropies from the covariance
  matrix of atom-positional fluctuations was tested. The approximation formula for
  entropy was obtained by comparing the results with analytical expressions for an
  ensemble of harmonic oscillators, for the ideal gas, and to the numerical results
  obtained from the equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid.
