abstract: Many proteins in their unbound structures lack surface pockets appropriately
  sized for drug binding. Hence, a variety of experimental and computational tools
  have been developed for the identification of cryptic sites that are not evident
  in the unbound protein but form upon ligand binding, and can provide tractable drug
  target sites. The goal of this review is to discuss the definition, detection, and
  druggability of such sites, and their potential value for drug discovery. Novel
  methods based on molecular dynamics simulations are particularly promising and yield
  a large number of transient pockets, but it has been shown that only a minority
  of such sites are generally capable of binding ligands with substantial affinity.
  Based on recent studies, current methodology can be improved by combining molecular
  dynamics with fragment docking and machine learning approaches.
