abstract: Protein-ligand interactions play key roles in various metabolic pathways,
  and the proteins involved in these interactions represent major targets for drug
  discovery. Mol. docking is widely used to predict the structure of protein-ligand
  complexes, and protein flexibility stands out as one of the most important and challenging
  issues for binding mode prediction. Various docking methods accounting for protein
  flexibility have been proposed, tackling problems of ever-increasing dimensionality.
  This paper presents an overview of conformational sampling methods treating target
  flexibility during mol. docking. Special attention is given to approaches considering
  full protein flexibility. Contrary to what is frequently done, this review does
  not rely on classical biomol. recognition models to classify existing docking methods.
  Instead, it applies algorithmic considerations, focusing on the level of flexibility
  accounted for. This review also discusses the diversity of docking applications,
  from virtual screening (VS) of small drug-like compds. to geometry prediction (GP)
  of protein-peptide complexes. Considering the diversity of docking methods presented
  here, deciding which one is the best at treating protein flexibility depends on
  the system under study and the research application. In VS expts., ensemble docking
  can be used to implicitly account for large-scale conformational changes, and selective
  docking can addnl. consider local binding-site rearrangements. In other cases, on-the-fly
  exploration of the whole protein-ligand complex might be needed for accurate GP
  of the binding mode. Among other things, future methods are expected to provide
  alternative binding modes, which will better reflect the dynamic nature of protein-ligand
  interactions. [on SciFinder(R)]
