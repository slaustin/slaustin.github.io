abstract: We propose a formulation of an adaptive computation of free energy differences,
  in the adaptive biasing force or nonequilibrium metadynamics spirit, using conditional
  distributions of samples of configurations which evolve in time. This allows us
  to present a truly unifying framework for these methods, and to prove convergence
  results for certain classes of algorithms. From a numerical viewpoint, a parallel
  implementation of these methods is very natural, the replicas interacting through
  the reconstructed free energy. We demonstrate how to improve this parallel implementation
  by resorting to some selection mechanism on the replicas. This is illustrated by
  computations on a model system of conformational changes. o̧pyright 2007 American
