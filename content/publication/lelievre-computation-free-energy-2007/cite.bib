 abstract = {We propose a formulation of an adaptive computation of free energy differences, in the adaptive biasing force or nonequilibrium metadynamics spirit, using conditional distributions of samples of configurations which evolve in time. This allows us to present a truly unifying framework for these methods, and to prove convergence results for certain classes of algorithms. From a numerical viewpoint, a parallel implementation of these methods is very natural, the replicas interacting through the reconstructed free energy. We demonstrate how to improve this parallel implementation by resorting to some selection mechanism on the replicas. This is illustrated by computations on a model system of conformational changes. o̧pyright 2007 American Institute of Physics.},
