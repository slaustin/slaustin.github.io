abstract: Expressions for the chemical potentials of the components of gas mixtures
  and liquid solutions are obtained in terms of relatively simple integrals in the
  configuration spaces of molecular pairs. The molecular pair distribution functions
  appearing in these integrals are investigated in some detail, in their dependence
  upon the composition and density of the fluid. The equation of state of a real gas
  mixture is discussed, and an approximate molecular pair distribution function, typical
  of dense fluids, is calculated. Applications of the method to the theory of solutions
  will be the subject of a later article.
