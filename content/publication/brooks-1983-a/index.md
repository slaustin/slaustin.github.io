abstract: CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics) is a highly flexible
  computer program which uses empirical energy functions to model macromolecular systems.
  The program can read or model build structures, energy minimize them by first- or
  second-derivative techniques, perform a normal mode or molecular dynamics simulation,
  and analyze the structural, equilibrium, and dynamic properties determined in these
  calculations. The operations that CHARMM can perform are described, and some implementation
  details are given. A set of parameters for the empirical energy function and a sample
  run are included.
