abstract: The structural changes that occur on ligand binding to haemoglobin have
  been studied by comparison of the atomic co-ordinates of human deoxy, horse met
  and human carbonmonoxy haemoglobin, using computer graphics and least-squares fitting
  methods. The changes that occur on going from deoxy to either of the liganded forms
  are very similar. These include tertiary structure changes within the $α$1$β$1 dimer
  and a quaternary structure change in which the packing of $α$1$β$1 against $α$2$β$2
  alters. On going from deoxy to liganded haemoglobin, no significant structural change
  occurs in the central regions of the $α$1$β$1 dimer, including the $α$1$β$1 interface
  and nearby helices B, C, G and H in both subunits. Movements occur in the outer
  parts of the dimer, where the haems, F helices and FG corners of both subunits move
  towards the centre of the molecule. The two haems and the two FG corners come ~2
  Å closer together. One important effect of the changes in both subunits is to translate
  the F helix across the face of the haem by ~1 Å. This moves the haem-linked histidine
  F8 from a position that is asymmetric with respect to the porphyrin nitrogens in
  deoxy to a more symmetric position in liganded haemoglobin. The motion of the $β$
  haem removes the ligand-binding site from the vicinity of Val$β$E11, which hinders
  ligand binding in deoxy. The changes in tertiary structure are linked to the quaternary
  change through the motion of the FG corners. The C helices and FG corners of $α$1$β$1
  are in contact with the FG corners and C helices of $α$2$β$2 in both quaternary
  structures. In the quaternary change the contacts between $α$1FG and $β$2C and between
  $α$2FG and $β$1C act as \"flexible joints\" allowing small relative motions. The
  same side-chains are involved in the contacts in both structures. The contacts between
  $α$1C and $β$2FG and between $α$2C and $β$1FG act as \"switch\" regions, having
  two different stable positions with different side-chains in contact. The change
  between the two positions involves a relative movement of ~6 Å. The quaternary structure
  change to liganded haemoglobin destroys the contacts made by the C-terminal residues
  of each subunit in deoxy haemoglobin, and these residues rotate freely in the liganded
  form. These structural results, together with other work, particularly the calculations
  of Gelin & Karplus and of Warshel, support a description of the haemoglobin mechanism
  in which (1) the binding of ligand to the deoxy form is accompanied by steric strain,
  originating from the particular position of the F helix and of His F8 relative to
  the haem. (2) The strain leads to decreased stability of the deoxy quaternary structure
  relative to the liganded quaternary structure, so that the proportion of molecules
  in the high-affinity form increases as successive ligands bind. (3) The quaternary
  structure change to the high-affinity form induces tertiary structure changes that
  reposition the F helix and HisF8 relative to the haem and there is then no strain
  on ligand binding. In the absence of ligand the deoxy structure is favoured by the
  greater surface area buried between $α$1$β$1 and $α$2$β$2 in this quaternary structure.
  Further implications of the structural results are discussed. o̧pyright 1979.
