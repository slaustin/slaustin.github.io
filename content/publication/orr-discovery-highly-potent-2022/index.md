abstract: The serotonin 5-HT2 receptors are important pharmaceutical targets involved
  in signaling pathways underlying various neurological, psychiatric, and cardiac
  functions and dysfunctions. As such, numerous ligands for the investigation of these
  receptors' activity and downstream effects have been developed synthetically or
  discovered in nature. For example, the heteroyohimbine natural product alstonine
  exhibits antispychotic activity mediated by 5-HT2A/2C agonism. In this work, we
  identified a heteroyohimbine metabolite containing a serotonin pharmacophore and
  truncated the scaffold, leading to the discovery of potent agonist activity of substituted
  tetrahydro-$β$-carbolines across the 5-HT2 receptor family. Extensive SAR development
  resulted in compound 106 with EC50 values of 1.7, 0.58, and 0.50 nM at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B,
  and 5-HT2C, respectively. Docking studies suggest a $π$-stacking interaction between
  the tetrahydro-$β$-carboline core and conserved residue Trp6.48 as the structural
  basis for this activity. This work lays a foundation for future investigation of
  these compounds in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
