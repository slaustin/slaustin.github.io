abstract: In this paper we describe the search strategies developed for docking flexible
  molecules to macomolecular sites that are incorporated into the widely distributed
  DOCK software, version 4.0. The search strategies include incremental construction
  and random conformation search and utilize the existing Coulombic and Lennard-Jones
  grid-based scoring function. The incremental construction strategy is tested with
  a panel of 15 crystallographic testcases, created from 12 unique complexes whose
  ligands vary in size and flexibility. For all testcases, at least one docked position
  is generated within 2 Å of the crystallographic position. For 7 of 15 testcases,
  the top scoring position is also within 2 Å of the crystallographic position. The
  algorithm is fast enough to successfully dock a few testcases within seconds and
  most within 100 s. The incremental construction and the random search strategy are
  evaluated as database docking techniques with a database of 51 molecules docked
  to two of the crystallographic testcases. Incremental construction outperforms random
  search and is fast enough to reliably rank the database of compounds within 15 s
  per molecule on an SGI R10000 cpu.
