abstract: The grail of protein science is the connection between structure and function.
  For myoglobin (Mb) this goal is close. Described as only a passive dioxygen storage
  protein in texts, we argue here that Mb is actually an allosteric enzyme that can
  catalyze reactions among small molecules. Studies of the structural, spectroscopic,
  and kinetic properties of Mb lead to a model that relates structure, energy landscape,
  dynamics, and function. Mb functions as a miniature chemical reactor, concentrating
  and orienting diatomic molecules such as NO, CO, O(2), and H(2)O(2) in highly conserved
  internal cavities. Reactions can be controlled because Mb exists in distinct taxonomic
  substates with different catalytic properties and connectivities of internal cavities.
