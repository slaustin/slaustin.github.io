abstract: Alternative inactive state of human $β<$u$>$2$<$/u$>$-adrenergic receptor
  ($β<$u$>$2$<$/u$>$-AR) originally exposed in Molecular Dynamics simulations was
  investigated using various analysis tools to evaluate causality between correlated
  residue-pair fluctuations and suggest allosteric communication pathways. Major conformational
  shift observed in the third intracellular loop (ICL3) displayed a novel inactive
  state, featuring an inaccessible G-protein binding site blocked by ICL3 and an expanded
  orthosteric ligand-binding site. Residue-based mean-square fluctuation and stiffness
  calculations revealed significant mobility decrease in ICL3, which induced mobility
  increase in remaining loop regions. This indicates conformational entropy loss in
  one mobile region being compensated by residual intermolecular motions in other
  mobile regions. Moreover, extent of significantly correlated motions decreased and
  correlations once existed between transmembrane helices shifted towards regions
  with increased mobility. Conditional time-...
