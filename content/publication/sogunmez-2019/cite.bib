 abstract = {Alternative inactive state of human $β<$u$>$2$<$/u$>$-adrenergic receptor ($β<$u$>$2$<$/u$>$-AR) originally exposed in Molecular Dynamics simulations was investigated using various analysis tools to evaluate causality between correlated residue-pair fluctuations and suggest allosteric communication pathways. Major conformational shift observed in the third intracellular loop (ICL3) displayed a novel inactive state, featuring an inaccessible G-protein binding site blocked by ICL3 and an expanded orthosteric ligand-binding site. Residue-based mean-square fluctuation and stiffness calculations revealed significant mobility decrease in ICL3, which induced mobility increase in remaining loop regions. This indicates conformational entropy loss in one mobile region being compensated by residual intermolecular motions in other mobile regions. Moreover, extent of significantly correlated motions decreased and correlations once existed between transmembrane helices shifted towards regions with increased mobility. Conditional time-...},
