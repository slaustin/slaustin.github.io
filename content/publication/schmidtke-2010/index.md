abstract: Druggability predictions are important to avoid intractable targets and
  to focus drug discovery efforts on sites offering better prospects. However, few
  druggability prediction tools have been released and none has been extensively tested.
  Here, a set of druggable and nondruggable cavities has been compiled in a collaborative
  platform (http://fpocket.sourceforge.net/dcd) that can be used, contributed, and
  curated by the community. Druggable binding sites are often oversimplified as closed,
  hydrophobic cavities, but data set analysis reveals that polar groups in druggable
  binding sites have properties that enable them to play a decisive role in ligand
  recognition. Finally, the data set has been used in conjunction with the open source
  fpocket suite to train and validate a logistic model. State of the art performance
  was achieved for predicting druggability on known binding sites and on virtual screening
  experiments where druggable pockets are retrieved from a pool of decoys. The algorithm
  is free, extremely fast, and can effectively be used to automatically sieve through
  massive collections of structures (http://fpocket.sourceforge.net). o̧pyright 2010
