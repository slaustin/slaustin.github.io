abstract: Atomistic simulations play a central role in many fields of science. However,
  their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized
  by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks.
  Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly
  longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling
  methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods
  based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and
  enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that
  has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual
  and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not
  just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the
  theory of statistical mechanics.
