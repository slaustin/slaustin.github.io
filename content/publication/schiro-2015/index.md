  water is the natural matrix of biological macromolecules and is essential for their
  activity in cells. The coupling between water and protein dynamics has been intensively
  studied, yet it remains controversial. Here we combine protein perdeuteration, neutron
  scattering and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the nature of hydration
  water motions at temperatures between 200 and 300K, across the so-called protein
  dynamical transition, in the intrinsically disordered human protein tau and the
  globular maltose binding protein. Quasi-elastic broadening is fitted with a model
  of translating, rotating and immobile water molecules. In both experiment and simulation,
  the translationa component markedly increases at the protein dynamical transition
  (around 240K), regardless of whether the protein is intrinsically disordered or
  folded. Thus, we generalize the notion that the translational diffusion of water
  molecules on a protein surface promotes the large-amplitude motions of proteins
  that are required for their biological activity.
