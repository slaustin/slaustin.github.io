abstract: Principal component analysis of molecular dynamics simulations is a popular
  method to account for the essential dynamics of the system on a low-dimensional
  free energy landscape. Using Cartesian coordinates, first the translation and overall
  rotation need to be removed from the trajectory. Since the rotation depends via
  the moment of inertia on the molecule's structure, this separation is only straightforward
  for relatively rigid systems. Adopting millisecond molecular dynamics simulations
  of the folding of villin headpiece and the functional dynamics of BPTI provided
  by D. E. Shaw Research, it is demonstrated via a comparison of local and global
  rotational fitting that the structural dynamics of flexible molecules necessarily
  results in a mixing of overall and internal motion. Even for the small-amplitude
  functional motion of BPTI, the conformational distribution obtained from a Cartesian
  principal component analysis therefore reflects to some extend the dominant overall
  motion rather than the much smaller internal motion of the protein. Internal coordinates
  such as backbone dihedral angles, on the other hand, are found to yield correct
  and well-resolved energy landscapes for both examples. The virtues and shortcomings
  of the choice of various fitting schemes and coordinate sets as well as the generality
  of these results are discussed in some detail.
