abstract: We explore a new approach in the rational design of specificity in molecular
  recognition of small molecules based on statistical-mechanical integral equation
  theory of molecular liquids in the form of the three-dimensional reference interaction
  site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). The numerically stable
  iterative solution of conventional 3D-RISM equations includes the fragmental decomposition
  of flexible ligands, which are treated as distinct species in solvent mixtures of
  arbitrary complexity. The computed density functions for solution (including ligand)
  molecules are obtained as a set of discrete spatial grids that uniquely describe
  the continuous solvent-site distribution around the protein solute. Potentials of
  mean force derived from these distributions define the scoring function interfaced
  with the AutoDock program for an automated ranking of docked conformations. As a
  case study in terms of solvent composition, we analyze cooperative interactions
  encountered in the binding of a flexible thiamine molecule to the prion protein
  at near-physiological conditions. The predicted location and residency times of
  computed binding modes are in excellent agreement with the available experimental
  data. o̧pyright 2012 American Chemical Society.
