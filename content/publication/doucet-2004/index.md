abstract: The conserved Class A $β$-lactamase active site residue Tyr-105 was substituted
  by saturation mutagenesis in TEM-1 $β$-lactamase from Escherichia coli in order
  to clarify its role in enzyme activity and in substrate stabilization and discrimination.
  Minimum inhibitory concentrations were calculated for E. coli cells harboring each
  Y105X mutant in the presence of various penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.
  We found that only aromatic residues as well as asparagine replacements conferred
  high in vivo survival rates for all substrates tested. At position 105, the small
  residues alanine and glycine provide weak substrate discrimination as evidenced
  by the difference in benzylpenicillin hydrolysis relative to cephalothin, two typical
  penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. Kinetic analyses of mutants of interest
  revealed that the Y105X replacements have a greater effect on Km than k cat, highlighting
  the importance of Tyr-105 in substrate recognition. Finally, by performing a short
  molecular dynamics study on a restricted set of Y105X mutants of TEM-1, we found
  that the strong aromatic bias observed at position 105 in Class A $β$-lactamases
  is primarily defined by a structural requirement, selecting planar residues that
  form a stabilizing wall to the active site. The adopted conformation of residue
  105 prevents detrimental steric interactions with the substrate molecule in the
  active site cavity and provides a rationalization for the strong aromatic bias found
  in nature at this position among Class A $β$-lactamases.
