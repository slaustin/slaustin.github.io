abstract: PASS (Putative Active Sites with Spheres) is a simple computational tool
  that uses geometry to characterize regions of buried volume in proteins and to identify
  positions likely to represent binding sites based upon the size, shape, and burial
  extent of these volumes. Its utility as a predictive tool for binding site identification
  is tested by predicting known binding sites of proteins in the PDB using both complexed
  macromolecules and their corresponding apo-protein structures. The results indicate
  that PASS can serve as a front-end to fast docking. The main utility of PASS lies
  in the fact that it can analyze a moderate-size protein (~30 kDa) in under 20 s,
  which makes it suitable for interactive molecular modeling, protein database analysis,
  and aggressive virtual screening efforts. As a modeling tool, PASS (i) rapidly identifies
  favorable regions of the protein surface, (ii) simplifies visualization of residues
  modulating binding in these regions, and (iii) provides a means of directly visualizing
  buried volume, which is often inferred indirectly from curvature in a surface representation.
  PASS produces output in the form of standard PDB files, which are suitable for any
  modeling package, and provides script files to simplify visualization in Cerius2®,
  InsightII®, MOE®, Quanta®, RasMol®, and Sybyl®, PASS is freely available to all.
