abstract: Allostery enables tight regulation of protein function in the cellular environment.
  Although existing models of allostery are firmly rooted in the current structure--function
  paradigm, the mechanistic basis for allostery in the absence of structural change
  remains unclear. In this study, we show that a typical globular protein is able
  to undergo significant changes in volume under native conditions while exhibiting
  no additional changes in protein structure. These native state volume fluctuations
  were found to correlate with changes in internal motions that were previously recognized
  as a source of allosteric entropy. This finding offers a novel mechanistic basis
  for allostery in the absence of canonical structural change. The unexpected observation
  that function can be derived from expanded, low density protein states has broad
  implications for our understanding of allostery and suggests that the general concept
  of the native state be expanded to allow for more variable physical dimensions with
  looser pac...
