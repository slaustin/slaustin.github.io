abstract: Solvation dynamics in polar liquids have been examined using the probe molecule
  coumarin 153 (Cu153) and picosecond spectroscopic techniques. Steady-state absorption
  and fluorescence spectra of Cu153 as a function of solvent show that the frequency
  of the electronic spectrum of this probe provides a convenient measure of solvation
  energetics. Both nonspecific dipolar and to a smaller degree H-bonding solute-solvent
  interactions are involved. Time-correlated single photon counting was used to observe
  time-dependent shifts of the fluorescence spectrum of Cu153 in a variety of alcohols,
  propylene carbonate, and N-methylpropionamide solvents as a function of temperature.
  These time-dependent spectral shifts provide a direct measure of the time dependence
  of the solvation process. Theoretical models that treat the solvent as a dielectric
  continuum do not adequately account for the observed solvation dynamics. In the
  solvents studied, such theories predict a single exponential shift of the fluorescence
  spectrum with a time constant equal to the longitudinal relaxation time (TL) of
  the solvent. We find that solvation is nonexponential in time and that the average
  time constant observed is, in general, greater than $τ$L. As the dielectric constant
  of the solvent increases the disagreement between the observed and predicted solvation
  times becomes more pronounced. For N-methylpropionamide ($ɛ$0$∼$ 300 at 245 K) solvation
  is observed to occur 15 times slower than predicted. These results are discussed
  in terms of the importance of general molecular aspects of solvation not included
  in a continuum description. The rotational dynamics of Cu153 in a number of polar
  solvents has also been examined using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements.
  In addition to the \"normal\" diffusive rotational dynamics we observe a much faster
  component of the anisotropy decays in polar solvents. The latter rotational component
  is correlated to the observed solvation time and appears to be due to rapid rotation
  of the transition dipole of Cu153 in response to changes in the solvent environment.
