abstract: Despite the numerous methods available for predicting the location and affinity
  of water molecules, there is still a degree of scepticism and reluctance towards
  using such information within a drug discovery program. Here, I review some of the
  most common and popular methods to assess whether these apparent concerns are justified.
  I suggest that the field is approaching maturity and that some methods are capable
  of giving quantitative predictions, which are confirmed experimentally. This suggests
  that water-placement methods should be used more widely to help direct chemistry
  efforts, although more successful examples are required to help validate the techniques.
