abstract: 'Translational motions of water molecules in various systems equilibrated
  at room temperature are thought to be diffusive and nondirectional. We performed
  molecular dynamics simulations of a protein system and showed that the water molecules
  collectively move around the protein. The motions of two water molecules, which
  were about 12 Å away from each other, are correlated to each other. Such collective
  motions of water can be regarded as flows around the protein, and the flows exhibited
  various coherent patterns: fair currents, vortices, and divergent flows. The patterns
  were highly fluctuating: a set of patterns changed to a different set of patterns
  within a time scale of 10 ps. Thus, the water motions observed in a scale of length
  smaller than 12 Å and a time scale shorter than 10 ps were nondiffusive, and the
  motions above these scales were diffusive, where the flows disappeared. The flows
  near the protein surface had an orientational propensity to be highly parallel to
  the protein surface, and this propensity gradually vanished with an increment of
  distance from the protein surface. The divergent patterns of flows, which frequently
  emerge during the fluctuations of flows, may temporarily cause solvent drying in
  the vicinity of solutes. The current simulation is supportive of a molecular interaction
  mechanism that the fluctuations of hydration structure induce attractive interactions
  between solutes. o̧pyright 2007 American Institute of Physics.'
