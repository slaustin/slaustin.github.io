abstract: 'We developed and implemented a statistical mechanical integral equation
  theory to describe the hydration structure of complex molecules. The theory, which
  is an extension of the reference interaction site model (RISM) in three dimensions,
  yields the average density from the solvent interactions sites at all points r around
  a molecular solute of arbitrary shape. Both solute-solvent electrostatic and van
  der Waals interactions are fully included, and solvent packing is taken into account.
  The approach is illustrated by calculating the average oxygen and hydrogen density
  of liquid water around two molecular solutes: water and N-methylacetamide. Molecular
  dynamics simulations are performed to test the results obtained from the integral
  equation. It is observed that important microscopic structural features of the average
  water density due to hydrogen bonding are reproduced by the integral equation. The
  integral equation has a simple formal structure and is easy to implement numerically.
  It offers a powerful alternative to computer simulations with explicit solvent molecules
  and to continuum solvent representations for incorporating solvation effects in
  a wide range of applications.'
