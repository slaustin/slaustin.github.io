abstract: This paper analyzes dynamic properties of hydrogen bonds in liquid water.
  We use molecular dynamics simulation to calculate different probability densities
  that govern the time evolution of the formation and rupture of hydrogen bonds. We
  provide analytical connections between these functions. Excellent agreement with
  our simulation results is observed. We prove transition state theory rate constant
  to be identical to the inverse of the associated mean first passage time (hydrogen
  bond lifetime). Hence, the analysis establishes its Arrhenius temperature dependence.
  We give the explicit relation between reactive flux correlation function for the
  relaxation dynamics of hydrogen bonds, and their first passage time probability
  densities. All the different observations in the existing literature, associated
  with various estimates of hydrogen bonding times in liquid water that are affected
  (or not affected) by particular bond criteria, as well as by different definitions
  of hydrogen bond lifetimes applied in simulation, can be easily reconciled within
  the framework of reactive flux correlation function approach
