abstract: A theoretical framework is presented to analyze how solvent water contributes
  to the X-ray scattering profile of protein solution. Molecular dynamics simulations
  were carried out on pure water and an aqueous solution of myoglobin to determine
  the spatial distribution of water molecules in each of them. Their solution X-ray
  scattering (SXS) profiles were numerically evaluated with obtained atomic-coordinate
  data. It is shown that two kinds of contributions from solvent water must be considered
  to predict the SXS profile of a solution accurately. One is the excluded solvent
  scattering originating in exclusion of water molecules from the space occupied by
  solutes. The other is the hydration effect resulting from formation of a specific
  distribution of water around solutes. Explicit consideration of only two molecular
  layers of water is practically enough to incorporate the hydration effect. Care
  should be given to using an approximation in which an averaged electron density
  distribution is assumed for the structure factor because it may predict profiles
  considerably deviating from the correct profile at large K. oÌ§pyright 2002 Elsevier
