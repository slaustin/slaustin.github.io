 abstract = {A theoretical framework is presented to analyze how solvent water contributes to the X-ray scattering profile of protein solution. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on pure water and an aqueous solution of myoglobin to determine the spatial distribution of water molecules in each of them. Their solution X-ray scattering (SXS) profiles were numerically evaluated with obtained atomic-coordinate data. It is shown that two kinds of contributions from solvent water must be considered to predict the SXS profile of a solution accurately. One is the excluded solvent scattering originating in exclusion of water molecules from the space occupied by solutes. The other is the hydration effect resulting from formation of a specific distribution of water around solutes. Explicit consideration of only two molecular layers of water is practically enough to incorporate the hydration effect. Care should be given to using an approximation in which an averaged electron density distribution is assumed for the structure factor because it may predict profiles considerably deviating from the correct profile at large K. oÌ§pyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
