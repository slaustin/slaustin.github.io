abstract: Many important protein functions are carried out through proton-coupled
  conformational dynamics. Thus, the ability to accurately model protonation states
  dynamically has wide-ranging implications. Over the past two decades, two main types
  of constant pH methods (discrete and continuous) have been developed to enable proton-coupled
  molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this short review, we discuss the current
  status of the development and highlight recent applications that have advanced our
  understanding of protein structure-function relationships. We conclude the review
  by outlining the remaining challenges in the method development and projecting important
  areas for future applications.
