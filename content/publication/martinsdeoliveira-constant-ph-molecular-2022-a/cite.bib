 abstract = {Many important protein functions are carried out through proton-coupled conformational dynamics. Thus, the ability to accurately model protonation states dynamically has wide-ranging implications. Over the past two decades, two main types of constant pH methods (discrete and continuous) have been developed to enable proton-coupled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this short review, we discuss the current status of the development and highlight recent applications that have advanced our understanding of protein structure-function relationships. We conclude the review by outlining the remaining challenges in the method development and projecting important areas for future applications.},
