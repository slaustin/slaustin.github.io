abstract: A new cluster series, called the interaction site cluster expansion, is
  derived for classical molecular fluids. For a general class of molecular models,
  the series provides an exact formula for the equilibrium pair correlations between
  interaction sites on different molecules. In the models considered, each molecule
  contains m of these interaction sites. The total intermolecular potential between
  two molecules is the sum of m 2 site--site potentials. A site--site potential depends
  on the separation between the sites only. However, because the sites are not necessarily
  located at the centers of molecules, the total molecular pair interaction can depend
  strongly on molecular orientations. Even though the interaction site cluster expansion
  is exact, the cluster integrals in the series involve the translational coordinates
  of the interaction sites only. The molecular orientational coordinates are removed
  by a transformation which introduces i n t r amolecular correlation functions into
  the series. Thus, the new cluster series expresses the intermolecular site--site
  correlation functions in terms of diagrams involving site--site cluster bonds and
  i n t r amolecular correlation bonds. The interaction site cluster expansions are
  used to derive several important results. It is shown that when the site--site interactions
  are hard core potentials, the pair correlation functions rigorously contain not
  only discontinuities but also cusps. The locations for these singularities are derived.
  A method is presented which shows how these singularities are smoothed when the
  hard core potentials are softened. The singularities as well as special limiting
  results derived herein are used to provide a justification for the reference interaction
  site model (RISM) equation.
