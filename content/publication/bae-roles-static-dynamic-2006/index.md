abstract: Protein dynamics, including conformational switching, are recognized to
  be crucial for the function of many systems. These motions are more challenging
  to study than simple static structures. Here, we present evidence suggesting that
  in the enzyme adenylate kinase large ``hinge bending'' motions closely related to
  catalysis are regulated by intrinsic properties of the moving domains and not by
  their hinges, by anchoring domains, or by remote allosteric-like regions. From a
  pair of highly homologous mesophilic and thermophilic adenylate kinases, we generated
  a series of chimeric enzymes using a previously undescribed method with synthetic
  genes. Subsequent analysis of the chimeras has revealed unexpected spatial separation
  of stability and activity control. Our results highlight specific contributions
  of dynamics to catalysis in adenylate kinase. Furthermore, the overall strategy
  and the specific mutagenesis method used in this study can be generally applied.
