abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a commonly known toxic gas compound, possesses unique
  chemical features that allow this small solute molecule to quickly diffuse through
  cell membranes. Taking advantage of the recent orthogonal space tempering (OST)
  method, we comparatively mapped the transmembrane free energy landscapes of H2S
  and its structural analogue, water (H2O), seeking to decipher the molecular determinants
  that govern their drastically different permeabilities. As revealed by our OST sampling
  results, in contrast to the highly polar water solute, hydrogen sulfide is evidently
  amphipathic, and thus inside membrane is favorably localized at the interfacial
  region, that is, the interface between the polar head-group and nonpolar acyl chain
  regions. Because the membrane binding affinity of H2S is mainly governed by its
  small hydrophobic moiety and the barrier height inbetween the interfacial region
  and the membrane center is largely determined by its moderate polarity, the transmembrane
  free energy barriers to encounter by this toxic molecule are very small. Moreover
  when H2S diffuses from the bulk solution to the membrane center, the above two effects
  nearly cancel each other, so as to lead to a negligible free energy difference.
  This study not only explains why H2S can quickly pass through cell membranes but
  also provides a practical illustration on how to use the OST free energy sampling
  method to conveniently analyze complex molecular processes.
