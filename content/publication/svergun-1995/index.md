abstract: A program for evaluating the solution scattering from macromolecules with
  known atomic structure is presented. The program uses multipole expansion for fast
  calculation of the spherically averaged scattering pattern and takes into account
  the hydration shell. Given the atomic coordinates (e.g. from the Brookhaven Protein
  Data Bank) it can either predict the solution scattering curve or fit the experimental
  scattering curve using only two free parameters, the average displaced solvent volume
  per atomic group and the contrast of the hydration layer. The program runs on IBM
  PCs and on the major UNIX platforms.
