 abstract = {A program for evaluating the solution scattering from macromolecules with known atomic structure is presented. The program uses multipole expansion for fast calculation of the spherically averaged scattering pattern and takes into account the hydration shell. Given the atomic coordinates (e.g. from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank) it can either predict the solution scattering curve or fit the experimental scattering curve using only two free parameters, the average displaced solvent volume per atomic group and the contrast of the hydration layer. The program runs on IBM PCs and on the major UNIX platforms.},
