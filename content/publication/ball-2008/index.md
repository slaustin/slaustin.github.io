abstract: Water is not a passive solvent in biology, but plays an active role in many
  biomolecular and cell processes. It can be regarded as a kind of biomolecule in
  its own right, adapting its structure and dynamics to the biological macromolecules
  and other cell solutes that it accommodates. In particular, water may hold the key
  to the way some proteins interact, fold and bind their substrates.
