abstract: The Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP) is a showcase example for entropic
  allostery. For full activation and DNA binding, the homodimeric protein requires
  the binding of two cyclic AMP (cAMP) molecules in an anti-cooperativemanner, the
  source of which appears to be largely of entropic nature according to previous experimental
  studies. We here study at atomic detail the allosteric regulation of CAP with Molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulations. We recover the experimentally observed entropic penalty
  for the second cAMP binding event with our recently developed force covariance entropy
  estimator and reveal allosteric communication pathways with Force Distribution Analyses
  (FDA). Our observations show that CAP binding results in characteristic changes
  in the interaction pathways connecting the two cAMP allosteric binding sites with
  each other, as well as with the DNA binding domains. We identified crucial relays
  in the mostly symmetric allosteric activation network, and suggest point mutants
  to test this mechanism. Our study suggests inter-residue forces, as opposed to coordinates,
  as a highly sensitive measure for structural adaptations that, even though minute,
  can very effectively propagate allosteric signals.
