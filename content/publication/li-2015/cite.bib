 abstract = {Protein kinase A is a prototypical phosphoryl transferase, sharing its catalytic core (PKA-C) with the entire kinase family. PKA-C substrate recognition, active site organization, and product re-lease depend on the enzyme's conformational transitions from the open to the closed state, which regulate its allosteric cooperativity. Here, we used equilibrium NMR hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) fractionation factors ($ǎrphi$) to probe the changes in the strength of hydrogen bonds within the kinase upon binding the nucleotide and a pseudo-substrate peptide (PKI5-24). We found that the $\řphi$ values decrease upon binding both ligands, suggesting that the overall hydrogen bond networks in both the small and large lobes of PKA-C becomes stronger. However, we observed several important exceptions, with residues displaying higher $\vp̌hi$ values upon ligand binding. Notably, the changes in $\vaȟi$ values are not localized near the ligand binding pockets; rather, they are radiated throughout the entire enzyme. We conclude that, upon ligand and pseudo-substrate binding, the hydrogen bond networks undergo extensive reorganization, revealing that the open-to-close transitions require global rearrangements of the internal forces that stabilize the enzyme's fold.},
