abstract: Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) perform a broad range of biological
  functions. Their relevance has motivated intense research activity seeking to characterize
  their sequence/structure/function relationships. However, the conformational plasticity
  of these molecules hampers the application of traditional structural approaches,
  and new tools and concepts are being developed to address the challenges they pose.
  Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is a structural biology technique that probes the size
  and shape of disordered proteins and their complexes with other biomolecules. The
  low-resolution nature of SAS can be compensated with specially designed computational
  tools and its combined interpretation with complementary structural information.
  In this review, we describe recent advances in the application of SAS to disordered
  proteins and highly flexible complexes and discuss current challenges.
