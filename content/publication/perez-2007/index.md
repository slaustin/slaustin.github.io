abstract: Since their first description more than 20 years ago, Escherichia coli and
  Klebsiella pneumoniae possessing extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamases (ESBLs)
  continue to thwart our best clinical efforts. In the 'early years' the most common
  beta-lactamases were of the TEM and SHV varieties. Now, CTX-M enzymes are being
  discovered throughout the world and are becoming the most prevalent beta-lactamases
  found in clinical isolates. The K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC) (ESBL-type enzymes
  that confer resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems) present
  the most significant challenge to date. Structural studies of ESBLs indicate that
  active site expansion and remodeling are responsible for this extended hydrolytic
  activity. Continuing questions still exist regarding the optimal detection method
  for ESBLs. Most relevant are the increasing concerns regarding the status of carbapenems
  as 'best therapy' for ESBL-producing bacteria in light of the emergence of carbapenemases.
