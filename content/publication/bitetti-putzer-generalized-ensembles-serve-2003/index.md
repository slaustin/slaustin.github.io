abstract: A novel method for the calculation of the free energy difference between
  two states of a molecular system is presented. The method, an extension of thermodynamic
  integration, treats the coupling parameter $łambda$ as a variable in an extended
  Hamiltonian formulation and propagates it with the physical coordinates. In the
  resulting generalized ensemble, the crossing of barriers in the physical space is
  enhanced. The free energy difference is determined by integrating the reversible
  work required to move $łambda$ from zero (corresponding to the initial state) to
  one (corresponding to the final state). Examples are presented to illustrate the
  method.
