abstract: A software package, MD2NOE, is presented which calculates Nuclear Overhauser
  Effect (NOE) build-up curves directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories.
  It differs from traditional approaches in that it calculates correlation functions
  directly from the trajectory instead of extracting inverse sixth power distance
  terms as an intermediate step in calculating NOEs. This is particularly important
  for molecules that sample conformational states on a timescale similar to molecular
  reorientation. The package is tested on sucrose and results are shown to differ
  in small but significant ways from those calculated using an inverse sixth power
  assumption. Results are also compared to experiment and found to be in reasonable
  agreement despite an expected underestimation of water viscosity by the water model
  selected.
