abstract: "A new web portal for the CHARMM macromolecular modeling package, CHARMMing
  (CHARMM interface and graphics, http://www.charmming.org), is presented. This tool
  provides a user-friendly interface for the preparation, submission, monitoring,
  and visualization of molecular simulations (i.e., energy minimization, solvation,
  and dynamics). The infrastructure used to implement the web application is described.
  Two additional programs have been developed and integrated with CHARMMing: GENRTF,
  which is employed to define structural features not supported by the standard CHARMM
  force field, and a job broker, which is used to provide a portable method for using
  grid and cluster computing with CHARMMing. The use of the program is described with
  three proteins: 1YJP, 1O1O, and 1UFY. Source code is provided allowing CHARMMing
  to be downloaded, installed, and used by supercomputing centers and research groups
  that have a CHARMM license. Although no software can replace a scientist's own judgment
  and experience, CHARMMing eases the introduction of newcomers to the molecular modeling
  discipline by providing a graphical method for running simulations."
