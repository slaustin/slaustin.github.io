abstract: The displacement of perturbed water upon binding is believed to play a critical
  role in the thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition, but it is nontrivial to
  unambiguously define and answer questions about this process. We address this issue
  by introducing grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST), which discretizes the
  equations of inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) onto a three-dimensional grid
  situated in the region of interest around a solute molecule or complex. Snapshots
  from explicit solvent simulations are used to estimate localized solvation entropies,
  energies, and free energies associated with the grid boxes, or voxels, and properly
  summing these thermodynamic quantities over voxels yields information about hydration
  thermodynamics. GIST thus provides a smoothly varying representation of water properties
  as a function of position, rather than focusing on hydration sites where solvent
  is present at high density. It therefore accounts for full or partial displacement
  of water from sites that are highly occupied by water, as well as for partly occupied
  and water-depleted regions around the solute. GIST can also provide a well-defined
  estimate of the solvation free energy and therefore enables a rigorous end-states
  analysis of binding. For example, one may not only use a first GIST calculation
  to project the thermodynamic consequences of displacing water from the surface of
  a receptor by a ligand, but also account, in a second GIST calculation, for the
  thermodynamics of subsequent solvent reorganization around the bound complex. In
  the present study, a first GIST analysis of the molecular host cucurbit[7]uril is
  found to yield a rich picture of hydration structure and thermodynamics in and around
  this miniature receptor. One of the most striking results is the observation of
  a toroidal region of high water density at the center of the host's nonpolar cavity.
  Despite its high density, the water in this toroidal region is disfavored energetically
  and entropically, and hence may contribute to the known ability of this small receptor
  to bind guest molecules with unusually high affinities. Interestingly, the toroidal
  region of high water density persists even when all partial charges of the receptor
  are set to zero. Thus, localized regions of high solvent density can be generated
  in a binding site without strong, attractive solute-solvent interactions. oÌ§pyright
