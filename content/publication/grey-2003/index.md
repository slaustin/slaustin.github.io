abstract: 'Conformational changes occurring on the microsecond-millisecond time scale
  in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) are investigated using nuclear magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy. The rczz CPMG experiment (Wang, C.; Grey, M. J.; Palmer,
  A. G. J. Biomol. NMR 2001, 21, 361-366) is used to record (15)N spin relaxation
  dispersion data, R(ex)(1/tau(cp)), in which 1/tau(cp) is the pulsing rate in the
  CPMG sequence, at two static magnetic fields, 11.7 and 14.1 T, and three temperatures,
  280, 290, and 300 K. These data are used to characterize the kinetics and mechanism
  of chemical exchange line broadening of the backbone (15)N spins of Cys 14, Lys
  15, Cys 38, and Arg 39 in BPTI. Line broadening is found to result from two processes:
  the previously identified isomerization of the Cys 38 side chain between chi(1)
  rotamers (Otting, G.; Liepinsh, E.; WÃ¼thrich, K. Biochemistry 1993, 32, 3571-3582)
  and a previously uncharacterized process on a faster time scale. At 300 K, both
  processes contribute significantly to the relaxation dispersion for Cys 14 and an
  analytical expression for a linear three-site exchange model is used to analyze
  the data. At 280 K, isomerization of the Cys 38 side chain is negligibly slow and
  the faster process dominates the relaxation dispersion for all four spins. Global
  analysis of the temperature and static field dependence of R(ex)(1/tau(cp)) for
  Cys 14 and Lys 15 is used to determine the activation parameters and chemical shift
  changes for the previously uncharacterized chemical exchange process. Through an
  analysis of a database of chemical shifts, (15)N chemical shift changes for Cys
  14 and Lys 15 are interpreted to result from a chi(1) rotamer transition of Cys
  14 that converts the Cys 14-Cys 38 disulfide bond between right- and left-handed
  conformations. At 290 K, isomerization of Cys 14 occurs with a forward and reverse
  rate constant of 35 s(-1) and 2500 s(-1), respectively, a time scale more than 30-fold
  faster than the Cys 38 chi(1) isomerization. A comparison of the kinetics and thermodynamics
  for the transitions between the two alternative Cys 14-Cys 38 conformations highlights
  the factors that affect the contribution of disulfide bonds to protein stability.'
