abstract: Transfer entropy, presented as a new tool for investigating neural assemblies,
  quantifies the fraction of information in a neuron found in the past history of
  another neuron. The asymmetry of the measure allows feedback evaluations. In particular,
  this tool has potential applications in investigating windows of temporal integration
  and stimulus-induced modulation of firing rate. Transfer entropy is also able to
  eliminate some effects of common history in spike trains and obtains results that
  are different from cross-correlation. The basic transfer entropy properties are
  illustrated with simulations. The information transfer through a network of 16 simultaneous
  multiunit recordings in cat's auditory cortex was examined for a large number of
  acoustic stimulus types. Application of the transfer entropy to a large database
  of multiple single-unit activity in cat's primary auditory cortex revealed that
  most windows of temporal integration found during spontaneous activity range between
  2 and 15 ms. The normalized transfer entropy shows similarities and differences
  with the strength of cross-correlation; these form the basis for revisiting the
  neural assembly concept. Copyright o̧pyright 2007 The American Physiological Society.
