abstract: A new pocket detection protocol successfully identified transient pockets
  on the protein surfaces of BCL-XL, IL-2, and MDM2. Because the native inhibitor
  binding pocket was absent or only partly detectable in the unbound proteins, these
  crystal structures were used as starting points for 10 ns long molecular dynamics
  simulations. Trajectory snapshots were scanned for cavities on the protein surface
  using the program PASS. The detected cavities were clustered to determine several
  distinct transient pockets. They all opened within 2.5 ps, and most of them appeared
  multiple times. All three systems gave similar results overall. At the native binding
  site, pockets of similar size compared with a known inhibitor bound could be observed
  for all three systems. AutoDock could successfully place inhibitor molecules into
  these transient pockets with less than 2 Å rms deviation from their crystal structures,
  suggesting this protocol as a viable tool to identify transient ligand binding pockets
  on protein surfaces. o̧pyright 2007 American Chemical Society.
