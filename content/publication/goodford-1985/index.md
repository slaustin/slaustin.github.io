abstract: The interaction of a probe group with a protein of known structure is computed
  at sample positions throughout and around the macromolecule, giving an array of
  energy values. The probes include water, the methyl group, amine nitrogen, carboxy
  oxygen, and hydroxyl. Contour surfaces at appropriate energy levels are calculated
  for each probe and displayed by computer graphics together with the protein structure.
  Contours at negative energy levels delineate regions of attraction between probe
  and protein and are found at known ligand binding clefts in particular. The contours
  also enable other regions of attraction to be identified and facilitate the interpretation
  of protein-ligand energetics. They may, therefore, be of value for drug design.
