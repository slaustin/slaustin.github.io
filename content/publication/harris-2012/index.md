abstract: Exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is taken up directly by bacteria,
  yeasts, fungi, and some parasites, which then induces the accumulation of protoporphyrin
  IX (PPIX). Subsequent light irradiation of PPIX leads to the inactivation of these
  organisms via photodamage to their cellular structures. ALA uptake and light irradiation
  of PPIX produced by host cells leads to the inactivation of other parasites, along
  with some viruses, via the induction of an immune response. ALA-mediated PPIX production
  by host cells and light irradiation result in the inactivation of other viruses
  via either the induction of a host cell response or direct photodynamic attack on
  viral particles. This ALA- mediated production of light-activated PPIX has been
  extensively used as a form of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and has shown varying levels
  of efficacy in treating conditions that are associated with microbial infection,
  ranging from acne and verrucae to leishmaniasis and onychomycosis. However, for
  the treatment of some of these conditions by ALA-based PDT, the role of an antimicrobial
  effect has been disputed and in general, the mechanisms by which the technique inactivates
  microbes are not well understood. In this study, we review current understanding
  of the antimicrobial mechanisms used by ALA-based PDT and its role in the treatment
  of microbial infections along with its potential medical and nonmedical applications.
