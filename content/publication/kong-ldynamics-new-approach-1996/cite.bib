 abstract = {We present a novel and efficient method for performing free energy calculations. Treating the conventional $łambda$ variables associated with the ``progress'' in the chemical coordinates dynamically, our approach transforms free energy calculations into calculating potentials of mean force in the $łambda$-space with molecular dynamics. This extended Hamiltonian formalism utilizes the full power of umbrella sampling techniques and the weighted histogram analysis method. Applications to free energies of hydration and a model illustrating competitive binding calculations are presented. These calculations demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the new $łambda$-dynamics approach.},
