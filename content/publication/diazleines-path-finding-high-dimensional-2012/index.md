abstract: We present a method for determining the average transition path and the
  free energy along this path in the space of selected collective variables. The formalism
  is based upon a history-dependent bias along a flexible path variable within the
  metadynamics framework but with a trivial scaling of the cost with the number of
  collective variables. Controlling the sampling of the orthogonal modes recovers
  the average path and the minimum free energy path as the limiting cases. The method
  is applied to resolve the path and the free energy of a conformational transition
  in alanine dipeptide.
