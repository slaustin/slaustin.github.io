abstract: Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation is a popular enhanced
  sampling method that is widely used for exploring the atomic mechanism of protein
  conformational change. However, the requirement of huge computational resources
  for REMD, especially with the explicit solvent model, largely limits its application.
  In this study, the availability and efficiency of a variant of velocity-scaling
  REMD (vsREMD) was assessed with adenylate kinase as an example. Although vsREMD
  achieved results consistent with those from conventional REMD and experimental studies,
  the number of replicas required for vsREMD (30) was much less than that for conventional
  REMD (80) to achieve a similar acceptance rate ($0.2), demonstrating high efficiency
  of vsREMD to characterize the protein conformational change and associated free-energy
  profile. Thus, vsREMD is a highly efficient approach for studying the large-scale
  conformational change of protein systems.
