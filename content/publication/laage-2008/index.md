abstract: We detail and considerably extend the analysis recently presented in Science
  2006, 311, 832- 835 of the molecular mechanism of water reorientation based on molecular
  dynamics simulations and the analytic framework of the extended jump model (EJM).
  The water reorientation is shown to occur through large-amplitude angular jumps
  due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from
  the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character
  of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully
  characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around
  the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time
  and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component
  of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting
  water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments.
  In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results,
  the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description
  of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is
  used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which
  the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor
  water approaches.
