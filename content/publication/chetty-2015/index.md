abstract: Abstract Although tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable disease, it still impacts
  highly on the morbidity and mortality of people in sub-Saharan Africa. This is largely
  attributed to drug resistance to the currently available drugs as well as co-infection
  with HIV. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB
  has necessitated the urgent need for the development of new drugs. DNA Gyrase B,
  a previously validated target for the aminocoumarins poses an attractive enzyme
  to target for the development of novel potent drugs. Previous biochemical assays
  suggest that the inhibitor diospyrin, binds to a novel binding site, close to the
  ATP binding site of the N-terminal domain of Gyrase B. To date, however, no available
  crystal structure of diospyrin in complex with Gyrase B has been reported. Thus,
  to investigate the position of this potential binding site, a robust homology model
  was built and validated, followed by docking and MD simulations. Thermodynamic calculations
  were used to estimate binding affinity. Binding free energy calculations revealed
  subtle differences in the binding at each site, however, the comprehensive computational
  analyses presented here, provide a substantially extensive illustration of the binding
  themes and affinities for each site, which offer value for the further design of
  novel inhibitors.
