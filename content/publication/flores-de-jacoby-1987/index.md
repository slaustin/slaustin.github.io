abstract: Kauzmann showed that the entropy of a liquid decreases rapidly on cooling
  towards the kinetic glass transition temperature and extrapolates to unreasonable
  values at lower temperature. The temperature where the extrapolated liquid entropy
  meets the crystal entropy is now called the Kauzmann temperature. Thermodynamics,
  with Planck's statement of the third law, shows that the entropy of a liquid cannot
  be less than the entropy of a glass with the same enthalpy. This is the thermodynamic
  condition violated by the Kauzmann extrapolation and it suggests a thermodynamic
  glass transition. Simulations show that, for the simple models studied and regardless
  of how the liquid entropy is extrapolated, the Kauzmann temperature cannot be reached
  because the entropy of glasses with the same enthalpy as the liquid is greater than
  that of the crystal.
