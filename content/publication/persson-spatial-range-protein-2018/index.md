abstract: Proteins interact with their aqueous surroundings, thereby modifying the
  physical properties of the solvent. The extent of this perturbation has been investigated
  by numerous methods in the past half-century, but a consensus has still not emerged
  regarding the spatial range of the perturbation. To a large extent, the disparate
  views found in the current literature can be traced to the lack of a rigorous definition
  of the perturbation range. Stating that a particular solvent property differs from
  its bulk value at a certain distance from the protein is not particularly helpful
  since such findings depend on the sensitivity and precision of the technique used
  to probe the system. What is needed is a well-defined decay length, an intrinsic
  property of the protein in a dilute aqueous solution, that specifies the length
  scale on which a given physical property approaches its bulk-water value. Based
  on molecular dynamics simulations of four small globular proteins, we present such
  an analysis of the structural and dynamic properties of the hydrogen-bonded solvent
  network. The results demonstrate unequivocally that the solvent perturbation is
  short-ranged, with all investigated properties having exponential decay lengths
  of less than one hydration shell. The short range of the perturbation is a consequence
  of the high energy density of bulk water, rendering this solvent highly resistant
  to structural perturbations. The electric field from the protein, which under certain
  conditions can be long-ranged, induces a weak alignment of water dipoles, which,
  however, is merely the linear dielectric response of bulk water and, therefore,
  should not be thought of as a structural perturbation. By decomposing the first
  hydration shell into polarity-based subsets, we find that the hydration structure
  of the nonpolar parts of the protein surface is similar to that of small nonpolar
  solutes. For all four examined proteins, the mean number of water-water hydrogen
  bonds in the nonpolar subset is within 1% of the value in bulk water, suggesting
  that the fragmentation and topography of the nonpolar protein-water interface has
  evolved to minimize the propensity for protein aggregation by reducing the unfavorable
  free energy of hydrophobic hydration.
