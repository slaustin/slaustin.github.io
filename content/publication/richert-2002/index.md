abstract: 'The disordered nature of glass-forming melts gives rise to non-Arrhenius
  and non-exponential behaviour of their dynamics. With respect to the microscopic
  details involved in the structural relaxation, these materials have remained an
  unsolved puzzle for over a century. The observation of spatial heterogeneity regarding
  the dynamics provides an important step towards understanding the relation between
  the macroscopic properties of soft condensed matter and the molecular mechanisms
  involved. On the other hand, dynamic heterogeneity is the source of several new
  questions: What is the length scale and persistence time associated with such clusters
  of relaxation time? What is the signature of heterogeneity at high temperatures
  and in the glassy state? How do these features depend on the particular material
  and on the correlation function used for probing these heterogeneities? This work
  attempts to review the various approaches to heterogeneous dynamics and the generally
  accepted results, as well as some controversial issues. Undoubtedly, heterogeneity
  has provoked a number of novel experimental techniques targeted at studying glass-forming
  liquids at the molecular level. It will be emphasized that the picture of heterogeneity
  is a requirement for rationalizing an increasing number of experimental observations
  rather than just an alternative model for the dynamics of molecules.'
