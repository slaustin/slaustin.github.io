abstract: Because of the complicated multistep nature of many biocatalytic reactions,
  an a priori definition of reaction coordinates is difficult. Therefore, we apply
  enhanced sampling algorithms along with adaptive path collective variables (PCVs),
  which converge to the minimum free energy path (MFEP) during the simulation. We
  show how PCVs can be combined with the highly efficient well-tempered metadynamics
  extended-system adaptive biasing force (WTM-eABF) hybrid sampling algorithm, offering
  dramatically increased sampling efficiency due to its fast adaptation to path updates.
  For this purpose, we address discontinuities of PCVs that can arise due to path
  shortcutting or path updates with a novel stabilization algorithm for extendedsystem
  methods. In addition, we show how the convergence of simulations can be further
  accelerated by utilizing the multistate Bennett's acceptance ratio (MBAR) estimator.
  These methods are applied to the first step of the enzymatic reaction mechanism
  of pseudouridine synthases, where the ability of path WTM-eABF to efficiently explore
  intricate molecular transitions is demonstrated.
