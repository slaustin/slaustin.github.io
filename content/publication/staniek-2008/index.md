abstract: We propose to estimate transfer entropy using a technique of symbolization.
  We demonstrate numerically that symbolic transfer entropy is a robust and computationally
  fast method to quantify the dominating direction of information flow between time
  series from structurally identical and nonidentical coupled systems. Analyzing multiday,
  multichannel electroencephalographic recordings from 15 epilepsy patients our approach
  allowed us to reliably identify the hemisphere containing the epileptic focus without
  observing actual seizure activity. o̧pyright 2008 The American Physical Society.
