abstract: Although serine proteases are found ubiquitously in both eukaryotes and
  prokaryotes, and they comprise the largest of all of the peptidase families, their
  dynamic motions remain obscure. The backbone dynamics of the coagulation serine
  protease, apo-thrombin (S195M-thrombin), were compared to the substrate-bound form
  (PPACK-thrombin). R 1, R 2, 15 N- 1 HNOEs, and relaxation dispersion NMR experiments
  were measured to capture motions across the ps to ms timescale. The ps-ns motions
  were not significantly altered upon substrate binding. The relaxation dispersion
  data revealed that apo-thrombin is highly dynamic, with $μ$s-ms motions throughout
  the molecule. The region around the N-terminus of the heavy chain, the Na + -binding
  loop, and the 170 s loop, all of which are implicated in allosteric coupling between
  effector binding sites and the active site, were dynamic primarily in the apo-form.
  Most of the loops surrounding the active site become more ordered upon PPACK-binding,
  but residues in the N-terminal part of the heavy chain, the $γ$-loop, and anion-binding
  exosite 1, the main allosteric binding site, retain $μ$s-ms motions. These residues
  form a dynamic allosteric pathway connecting the active site to the main allosteric
  site that remains in the substrate-bound form.
