abstract: 1-Deoxy-               d               -xylulose 5-phosphate (               DXP               )
  synthase catalyzes the formation of               DXP               from pyruvate
  and               d               -glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Gra               P               )
  in a thiamin diphosphate-dependent manner, and is the first step in the essential
  pathway to isoprenoids in human pathogens. Understanding the mechanism of this unique
  enzyme is critical for developing new anti-infective agents that selectively target
  isoprenoid biosynthesis. The present study used mutagenesis and a combination of
  protein fluorescence,               CD               and kinetics experiments to
  investigate the roles of Arg420, Arg478 and Tyr392 in substrate binding and catalysis.
  The results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism, and predict
  that Arg420 and Arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate, Gra               P               .               d               -Glyceraldehyde,
  an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl group predicted to interact
  with Arg420 and Arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation of the predecarboxylation
  intermediate C2$Î±$-lactylthiamin diphosphate (               LT               h               DP               )
  on               DXP               synthase, indicating that this binding interaction
  is not absolutely required, and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation.
  Unexpectedly, Tyr392 contributes to Gra               P               affinity,
  and is not required for               LT               h               DP               formation
  or its Gra               P               -promoted decarboxylation. Time-resolved               CD               spectroscopy
  and               NMR               experiments indicate that               LT               h               DP               is
  significantly stabilized on R420A and Y392F variants as compared with wild-type               DXP               synthase
  in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions do not appear to affect
  the rate of Gra               P               -promoted               LT               h               DP               decarboxylation
  in the presence of high levels of Gra               P               , and               LT               h               DP               formation
  remains the rate-limiting step. These results suggest a role of these residues in
  promoting Gra               P               binding, which in turn facilitates decarboxylation,
  and also highlight interesting differences between               DXP               synthase
  and other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes.
