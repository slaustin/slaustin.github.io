abstract: This tutorial is designed to help users overcome sampling challenges and
  improve computational efficiency in collective-variable (CV)-based enhanced-sampling,
  or importance-sampling, simulations. Toward this end, we introduce well-tempered
  metadynamics-extended adaptive biasing force (WTM-eABF) and its integration with
  Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD). Additionally, use will be made of
  a method for identifying the least-free-energy pathway (LFEP) and multiple concurrent
  pathways on high-dimensional free-energy surfaces. We illustrate these sampling
  techniques with the conformational equilibria of trialanine and chignolin in aqueous
  solution as test cases. This tutorial assumes that the user has prior experience
  with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in general, with the popular program NAMD,
  and to some extent with Colvars, the module for CV-based calculations. This tutorial
  can, however, in large measure be used in conjunction with alternate MD engines
  that support the Colvars module such as GROMACS, LAMMPS, and Tinker-HP.
