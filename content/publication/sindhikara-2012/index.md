abstract: We have created a simple algorithm for automatically predicting the explicit
  solvent atom distribution of biomolecules. The explicit distribution is coerced
  from the three-dimensional (3D) continuous distribution resulting from a 3D reference
  interaction site model (3D-RISM) calculation. This procedure predicts optimal location
  of solvent molecules and ions given a rigid biomolecular structure and the solvent
  composition. We show examples of predicting water molecules near the KNI-272 bound
  form of HIV-1 protease and predicting both sodium ions and water molecules near
  the rotor ring of F-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase. Our results give excellent
  agreement with experimental structure with an average prediction error of 0.39-0.65
  Å. Further, unlike experimental methods, this method does not suffer from the partial
  occupancy limit. Our method can be performed directly on 3D-RISM output within minutes.
  It is extremely useful for examining multiple specific solvent-solute interactions,
  as a convenient method for generating initial solvent structures for molecular dynamics
  calculations, and may assist in refinement of experimental structures. o̧pyright
