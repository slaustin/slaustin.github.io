abstract: To determine the thermodynamic role of binding of an operon to cAMPnreceptor
  protein (CRP) in the activation of transcription, isothermalntitration calorimetry
  measurements were performed on the bindingnof three 40-base pair DNA sequences to
  the cyclic nucleoside complexesnof CRP and its mutants at 296 K. The three 40-base
  pair sequencesnconsisted of a consensus DNA (conDNA) duplex derived from the CRP-nbinding
  site sequences of the operons activated by CRP and two DNAnsequences based on the
  CRP-binding site sequences of the lac operonn(lacDNA) and of the gal operon (galDNA).
  The mutants of CRP consistednof a T127L mutant, a S128A mutant, and a mutant containing
  both mutationsn(CRP*) which not only alter the transcriptional activity of the CRPncomplexes
  but also are involved in the monomer-monomer interfacialninteractions of the CRP
  dimer. The binding reactions of the DNA duplexesnto the fully cNMP-ligated CRP-mutant
  complexes were endothermic withnbinding constants as high as 6.6 +/- 1.1 x 10(6)
  M-1 (conDNA.CRP(cAMP)2).nConDNA binding to the unligated T127L and CRP* mutants
  was observednas well as conDNA and lacDNA binding to CRP with cAMP bound to onlynone
  monomer. The reduction of the binding constants with increasenin KCl concentration
  indicated the formation of two ion pairs fornthe cAMP-ligated CRP and S128A complexes
  and four ion pairs for thencAMP-ligated T127L and CRP* complexes. Reduction of the
  DNA bindingnconstants upon substitution of D2O for H2O in the buffer, the largenheat
  capacity changes, and the enthalpy-entropy compensation exhibitednby the binding
  reactions indicate the importance of dehydration innthe binding reaction. Small
  angle neutron scattering measurementsnon the lacDNA.CRP(cAMP)2 complex in D2O/H2O
  mixtures show that thenDNA is bent around the cAMP-ligated protein in solution.
