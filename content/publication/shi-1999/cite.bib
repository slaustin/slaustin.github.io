 abstract = {To determine the thermodynamic role of binding of an operon to cAMP\nreceptor protein (CRP) in the activation of transcription, isothermal\ntitration calorimetry measurements were performed on the binding\nof three 40-base pair DNA sequences to the cyclic nucleoside complexes\nof CRP and its mutants at 296 K. The three 40-base pair sequences\nconsisted of a consensus DNA (conDNA) duplex derived from the CRP-\nbinding site sequences of the operons activated by CRP and two DNA\nsequences based on the CRP-binding site sequences of the lac operon\n(lacDNA) and of the gal operon (galDNA). The mutants of CRP consisted\nof a T127L mutant, a S128A mutant, and a mutant containing both mutations\n(CRP*) which not only alter the transcriptional activity of the CRP\ncomplexes but also are involved in the monomer-monomer interfacial\ninteractions of the CRP dimer. The binding reactions of the DNA duplexes\nto the fully cNMP-ligated CRP-mutant complexes were endothermic with\nbinding constants as high as 6.6 +/- 1.1 x 10(6) M-1 (conDNA.CRP(cAMP)2).\nConDNA binding to the unligated T127L and CRP* mutants was observed\nas well as conDNA and lacDNA binding to CRP with cAMP bound to only\none monomer. The reduction of the binding constants with increase\nin KCl concentration indicated the formation of two ion pairs for\nthe cAMP-ligated CRP and S128A complexes and four ion pairs for the\ncAMP-ligated T127L and CRP* complexes. Reduction of the DNA binding\nconstants upon substitution of D2O for H2O in the buffer, the large\nheat capacity changes, and the enthalpy-entropy compensation exhibited\nby the binding reactions indicate the importance of dehydration in\nthe binding reaction. Small angle neutron scattering measurements\non the lacDNA.CRP(cAMP)2 complex in D2O/H2O mixtures show that the\nDNA is bent around the cAMP-ligated protein in solution.},
