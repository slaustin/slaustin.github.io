abstract: Enterobacter cloacae has been associated with several outbreaks, usually
  involving strains that overproduce chromosomal ?-lactamase or, uncommonly, strains
  expressing extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBL). Only sporadic cases of ESBL-producing
  E. cloacae have been identified in our hospital in recent years. We describe the
  epidemiology and clinical and microbiological characteristics of an outbreak caused
  by ESBL-producing E. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CT-ICU). Prospective
  surveillance of patients with infection or colonization by ESBL-producing E. cloacae
  among patients admitted to the CT-ICU was performed during the outbreak. Production
  of ESBL was determined by decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins
  and a positive double-disk test result. Clone relatedness was determined by pulsed-field
  gel electrophoresis (PFGE). From July to September 2005, seven patients in the CT-ICU
  with ESBL-producing E. cloacae were identified (four males; median age, 73 years;
  range, 45 to 76 years); six patients had cardiac surgery. Four patients developed
  infections; three had primary bacteremia, one had ventilator-associated pneumonia,
  and one had tracheobronchitis. ESBL- producing E. cloacae showed resistance to quinolones
  and aminoglycosides. PFGE revealed two patterns. Five isolates belonged to clone
  A; two carried a single ESBL (pI 8.2 and a positive PCR result for the SHV type),
  and three carried two ESBLs (pIs 8.1 and 8.2 and positive PCR results for the SHV
  and CTX-M-9 types). Isolates belonging to clone B carried a single ESBL (pI 5.4
  and a positive PCR result for theTEMtype). Review of antibiotic consumption showed
  increased use of cefepime and quinolones during June and July 2005. The outbreak
  was stopped by the implementation of barrier measures and cephalosporin restriction.
  ESBL production could be increasingly common in nosocomial pathogens other than
  Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.
