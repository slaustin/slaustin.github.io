abstract: We propose an adaptive biasing algorithm aimed at enhancing the sampling
  of multimodal measures by Langevin dynamics. The underlying idea consists in generalizing
  the standard adaptive biasing force method commonly used in conjunction with molecular
  dynamics to handle in a more effective fashion multidimensional reaction coordinates.
  The proposed approach is anticipated to be particularly useful for reaction coordinates,
  the components of which are weakly coupled, as illuminated in a mathematical analysis
  of the long-time convergence of the algorithm. The strength as well as the intrinsic
  limitation of the method are discussed and illustrated in two realistic test cases.
