abstract: Identification and size characterization of surface pockets and occluded
  cavities are initial steps in protein structure-based ligand design. A new program,
  CAST, for automatically locating and measuring protein pockets and cavities, is
  based on precise computational geometry methods, including alpha shape and discrete
  flow theory. CAST identifies and measures pockets and pocket mouth openings, as
  well as cavities. The program specifies the atoms lining pockets, pocket openings,
  and buried cavities; the volume and area of pockets and cavities; and the area and
  circumference of mouth openings. CAST analysis of over 100 proteins has been carried
  out; proteins examined include a set of 51 monomeric enzyme-ligand structures, several
  elastase-inhibitor complexes, the FK506 binding protein, 30 HIV-1 protease-inhibitor
  complexes, and a number of small and large protein inhibitors. Medium-sized globular
  proteins typically have 10-20 pockets/cavities. Most often, binding sites are pockets
  with 1-2 mouth openings; much less frequently they are cavities. Ligand binding
  pockets vary widely in size, most within the range 102-103 Å3. Statistical analysis
  reveals that the number of pockets and cavities is correlated with protein size,
  but there is no correlation between the size of the protein and the size of binding
  sites. Most frequently, the largest pocket/cavity is the active site, but there
  are a number of instructive exceptions. Ligand volume and binding site volume are
  somewhat correlated when binding site volume is $łeq$700 Å3, but the ligand seldom
  occupies the entire site. Auxiliary pockets near the active site have been suggested
  as additional binding surface for designed ligands (Mattos C et al., 1994, Nat Struct
  Biol 1:55-58). Analysis of elastase-inhibitor complexes suggests that CAST can identify
  ancillary pockets suitable for recruitment in ligand design strategies. Analysis
  of the FK506 binding protein, and of compounds developed in SAR by NMR (Shuker SB
  et al., 1996, Science 274:1531-1534), indicates that CAST pocket computation may
  provide a priori identification of target proteins for linked-fragment design. CAST
  analysis of 30 HIV-1 protease- inhibitor complexes shows that the flexible active
  site pocket can vary over a range of 853-1,566 Å3, and that there are two pockets
  near or adjoining the active site that may be recruited for ligand design.
