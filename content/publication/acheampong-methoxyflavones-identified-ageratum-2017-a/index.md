abstract: New therapies for leukemia are urgently needed due to adverse side effects,
  tumor resistance and lack of selectivity of many chemotherapeutic agents in clinical
  use. Ageratum conyzoides has been used in folklore medicine for managing leukemia
  and other cancers. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of fractions,
  sub-fractions and purified compounds from the ethanol leaf extracts of A. conyzoides
  against Jurkat cells-model for acute T cell leukemia. A two-dimensional purification
  process using normal phase flash, followed by reverse phase purification was necessary
  to isolate pure methoxy-flavones, which were further characterized by Nuclear Magnetic
  Resonance (NMR) and MS-MS. The effect of fractions or pure compounds on cell viability
  was determined using either the MTT reagent or CellTiter-Blue® assay, while the
  caspase-3 and -7 activation was tested with Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay. Prediction of
  compounds' drug disposition profiles in vivo was measured with biomimetic affinity
  chromatography methodologies.
