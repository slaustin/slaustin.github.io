abstract: 'The enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) is a key enzyme
  in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway and is a target for the development
  of antibiotics, herbicides, and antimalarial drugs. DXPS catalyzes the formation
  of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), a branch point metabolite in isoprenoid
  biosynthesis, and is also used in the biosynthesis of thiamin (vitamin B1) and pyridoxal
  (vitamin B6). Previously, we found that DXPS is unique among the superfamily of
  thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes in stabilizing the predecarboxylation
  intermediate, C2-alpha-lactyl-thiamin diphosphate (LThDP), which has subsequent
  decarboxylation that is triggered by d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP). Herein,
  we applied hydrogen--deuterium (H/D) exchange MS (HDX-MS) of full-length Escherichia
  coli DXPS to provide a snapshot of the conformational dynamics of this enzyme, leading
  to the following conclusions. (i) The high sequence coverage of DXPS allowed us
  to monitor structural changes throughout the entire enzyme, including two segments
  (spanning residues 183--238 and 292--317) not observed by X-ray crystallography.
  (ii) Three regions of DXPS (spanning residues 42--58, 183--199, and 278--298) near
  the active center displayed both EX1 (monomolecular) and EX2 (bimolecuar) H/D exchange
  (HDX) kinetic behavior in both ligand-free and ligand-bound states. All other peptides
  behaved according to the common EX2 kinetic mechanism. (iii) The observation of
  conformational changes on DXPS provides support for the role of conformational dynamics
  in the DXPS mechanism: The closed conformation of DXPS is critical for stabilization
  of LThDP, whereas addition of GAP converts DXPS to the open conformation that coincides
  with decarboxylation of LThDP and DXP release.'
