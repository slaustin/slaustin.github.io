abstract: Evidence from a variety of spectroscopic probes indicates that (, ) values
  corresponding to the left-handed polyproline II helix (PII) are preferred for short
  alanine-based peptides in water. On the basis of results from theoretical studies,
  it is believed that the observed preference is dictated by favorable peptide-solvent
  interactions, which are realized through formation of optimal hydrogen-bonding water
  bridges between peptide donor and acceptor groups. In the present study, we address
  this issue explicitly by analyzing the hydration structure and thermodynamics of
  16 low-energy conformers of the alanine dipeptide (N-acetylalanine-N'-methylamide)
  in liquid water. Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble were performed
  under ambient conditions with all-atom OPLS parameters for the alanine dipeptide
  and the TIP5P model for water. We find that the number of hydrogen-bonded water
  molecules connecting the peptide group donor and acceptor atoms has no effect on
  the solvation thermodynamics. Instead, the latter are determined by the work done
  to fully hydrate the peptide. This work is minimal for conformations that are characterized
  by a minimal overlap of the primary hydration shells around the peptide donor and
  acceptor atoms. As a result, peptide-solvent interactions favor \"compact\" conformations
  that do not include PII-like geometries. Our main conclusion is that the experimentally
  observed preference for PII does not arise due to favorable direct interactions
  between the peptide and water molecules. Instead, the latter act to unmask underlying
  conformational preferences that are a consequence of minimizing intrapeptide steric
  conflicts.
