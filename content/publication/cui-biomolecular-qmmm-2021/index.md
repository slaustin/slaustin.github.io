abstract: QM/MM simulations have become an indispensable tool in many chemical and
  biochemical investigations. Considering the tremendous degree of success, including
  recognition by a 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are there still ``burning challenges''
  in QM/MM methods, especially for biomolecular systems? In this short Perspective,
  we discuss several issues that we believe greatly impact the robustness and quantitative
  applicability of QM/MM simulations to many, if not all, biomolecules. We highlight
  these issues with observations and relevant advances from recent studies in our
  group and others in the field. Despite such limited scope, we hope the discussions
  are of general interest and will stimulate additional developments that help push
  the field forward in meaningful directions.
