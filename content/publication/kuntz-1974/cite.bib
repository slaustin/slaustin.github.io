 abstract = {This chapter describes many of the techniques employed to study water-macromolecules interactions, their general usefulness, points out areas of mutual support and contradiction. The chapter also presents hydration of other macromolecules and the hydration of small molecules. Four broadly based approaches to operational definitions of hydration include---(1) preferential hydration, (2) hydrodynamic hydration, (3) structural hydration, and (4) low temperature hydration. The use of high resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction data on protein crystals provides an independent approach for estimation of hydration. The chapter presents several proposals for predicting protein hydration based on the amino acid composition of the protein; however, the two main questions concerned include---whether ionic groups are more hydrated than other polar groups, and whether the amide and peptide functions are hydrated or not. Low pH, and to a much smaller degree, high pH should dehydrate proteins. Intermolecular association via ionic mechanisms should be strongly dehydrating; whereas hydrophobic interactions should not have much effect on hydration levels. Although, there is a presumption that both the enthalpy and the entropy are negative for the process of adding water molecules to isolated proteins, which are maintained in their native conformations, but there is no unequivocal evidence for this. oÌ§pyright 1974 Academic Press Inc.},
