abstract: This chapter describes many of the techniques employed to study water-macromolecules
  interactions, their general usefulness, points out areas of mutual support and contradiction.
  The chapter also presents hydration of other macromolecules and the hydration of
  small molecules. Four broadly based approaches to operational definitions of hydration
  include---(1) preferential hydration, (2) hydrodynamic hydration, (3) structural
  hydration, and (4) low temperature hydration. The use of high resolution X-ray and
  neutron diffraction data on protein crystals provides an independent approach for
  estimation of hydration. The chapter presents several proposals for predicting protein
  hydration based on the amino acid composition of the protein; however, the two main
  questions concerned include---whether ionic groups are more hydrated than other
  polar groups, and whether the amide and peptide functions are hydrated or not. Low
  pH, and to a much smaller degree, high pH should dehydrate proteins. Intermolecular
  association via ionic mechanisms should be strongly dehydrating; whereas hydrophobic
  interactions should not have much effect on hydration levels. Although, there is
  a presumption that both the enthalpy and the entropy are negative for the process
  of adding water molecules to isolated proteins, which are maintained in their native
  conformations, but there is no unequivocal evidence for this. oÌ§pyright 1974 Academic
