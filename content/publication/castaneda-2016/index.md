abstract: Summary Polyubiquitination, a critical protein post-translational modification,
  signals for a diverse set of cellular events via the different isopeptide linkages
  formed between the C terminus of one ubiquitin (Ub) and the E-amine of K6, K11,
  K27, K29, K33, K48, or K63 of a second Ub. We assembled di-ubiquitins (Ub2) comprising
  every lysine linkage and examined them biochemically and structurally. Of these,
  K27-Ub2 is unique as it is not cleaved by most deubiquitinases. As this remains
  the only structurally uncharacterized lysine linkage, we comprehensively examined
  the structures and dynamics of K27-Ub2 using nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle
  neutron scattering, and in silico ensemble modeling. Our structural data provide
  insights into the functional properties of K27-Ub2, in particular that K27-Ub2 may
  be specifically recognized by K48-selective receptor UBA2 domain from proteasomal
  shuttle protein hHR23a. Binding studies and mutagenesis confirmed this prediction,
  further highlighting structural/recognition versatility of polyubiquitins and the
  potential power of determining function from elucidation of conformational ensembles.
