 abstract = {A relationship between molecular dynamics motions of noncatalytic residues and enzyme activity has re- cently been proposed. We present examples where mutations either near or distal from the active site residues modify internal enzyme motion with resulting modification of catalysis. A better understanding of internal protein motions correlated to catalysis will lead to a greater insight into enzyme function.},
