abstract: A relationship between molecular dynamics motions of noncatalytic residues
  and enzyme activity has re- cently been proposed. We present examples where mutations
  either near or distal from the active site residues modify internal enzyme motion
  with resulting modification of catalysis. A better understanding of internal protein
  motions correlated to catalysis will lead to a greater insight into enzyme function.
