abstract: An N$·$log(N) method for evaluating electrostatic energies and forces of
  large periodic systems is presented. The method is based on interpolation of the
  reciprocal space Ewald sums and evaluation of the resulting convolutions using fast
  Fourier transforms. Timings and accuracies are presented for three large crystalline
  ionic systems.
