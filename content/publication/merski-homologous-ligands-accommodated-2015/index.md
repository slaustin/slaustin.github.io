abstract: Conformational change in protein--ligand complexes is widely modeled, but
  the protein accommodation expected on binding a congeneric series of ligands has
  received less attention. Given their use in medicinal chemistry, there are surprisingly
  few substantial series of congeneric ligand complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
  Here we determine the structures of eight alkyl benzenes, in single-methylene increases
  from benzene to n-hexylbenzene, bound to an enclosed cavity in T4 lysozyme. The
  volume of the apo cavity suffices to accommodate benzene but, even with toluene,
  larger cavity conformations become observable in the electron density, and over
  the series two other major conformations are observed. These involve discrete changes
  in main-chain conformation, expanding the site; few continuous changes in the site
  are observed. In most structures, two discrete protein conformations are observed
  simultaneously, and energetic considerations suggest that these conformations are
  low in energy relative to the ground state. An analysis of 121 lysozyme cavity structures
  in the PDB finds that these three conformations dominate the previously determined
  structures, largely modeled in a single conformation. An investigation of the few
  congeneric series in the PDB suggests that discrete changes are common adaptations
  to a series of growing ligands. The discrete, but relatively few, conformational
  states observed here, and their energetic accessibility, may have implications for
  anticipating protein conformational change in ligand design.
