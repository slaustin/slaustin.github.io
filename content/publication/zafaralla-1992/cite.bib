 abstract = {The highly conserved Arg-244 in $β$-lactamases has previously been postulated to play a role in their initial recognition of substrates, presumably through ion pairing interactions.  However, in the Michaelis enzyme-substrate complex, no direct function has been attributed to this residue.  Two mutants with substitutions of this residue in TEM-1 $β$-lactamase (Lys-244 and Ser-244) were prepd. to explore whether the guanidinium group of Arg-244 plays a crit. role in the turnover processes.  The mutant enzymes were effective catalysts for the hydrolysis of both penicillins and cephalosporins, and the Lys-244 mutant enzyme behaved virtually identically to the wild-type $β$-lactamase.  Comparative kinetic characterization of the Ser-244 mutant and wild-type enzymes attributed binding energies of 1.3-2.3 kcal/mol for the penicillins and 0.3-1.0 kcal/mol for the cephalosporins to the transition-state species by Arg-244.  Furthermore, it was shown that Arg-244 also contributes equally well to ground-state binding stabilization.  These results were interpreted to indicate the involvement of a long H-bond between Arg-244 and the substrate carboxylate, both in the ground and transition states.  A reassessed picture for substrate anchoring involving interactions of the substrate carboxylate with the side-chains of Ser-130, Ser-235, and Arg-244 is proposed to accommodate these observations.
