abstract: The highly conserved Arg-244 in $β$-lactamases has previously been postulated
  to play a role in their initial recognition of substrates, presumably through ion
  pairing interactions.  However, in the Michaelis enzyme-substrate complex, no direct
  function has been attributed to this residue.  Two mutants with substitutions of
  this residue in TEM-1 $β$-lactamase (Lys-244 and Ser-244) were prepd. to explore
  whether the guanidinium group of Arg-244 plays a crit. role in the turnover processes.  The
  mutant enzymes were effective catalysts for the hydrolysis of both penicillins and
  cephalosporins, and the Lys-244 mutant enzyme behaved virtually identically to the
  wild-type $β$-lactamase.  Comparative kinetic characterization of the Ser-244 mutant
  and wild-type enzymes attributed binding energies of 1.3-2.3 kcal/mol for the penicillins
  and 0.3-1.0 kcal/mol for the cephalosporins to the transition-state species by Arg-244.  Furthermore,
  it was shown that Arg-244 also contributes equally well to ground-state binding
  stabilization.  These results were interpreted to indicate the involvement of a
  long H-bond between Arg-244 and the substrate carboxylate, both in the ground and
  transition states.  A reassessed picture for substrate anchoring involving interactions
  of the substrate carboxylate with the side-chains of Ser-130, Ser-235, and Arg-244
  is proposed to accommodate these observations. [on SciFinder(R)]
