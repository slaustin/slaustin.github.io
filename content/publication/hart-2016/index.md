abstract: TEM $Î²$-lactamase confers bacteria with resistance to many antibiotics and
  rapidly evolves activity against new drugs. However, functional changes are not
  easily explained by differences in crystal structures. We employ Markov state models
  to identify hidden conformations and explore their role in determining TEM's specificity.
  We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique,
  called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts TEM specificity by accounting for
  conformational heterogeneity. Using our MSMs, we identify hidden states whose populations
  correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted
  hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models'
  prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced textohm-loop
  flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase
  states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro
  and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in
  drug and protein design.
