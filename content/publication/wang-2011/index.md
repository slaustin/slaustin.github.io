abstract: New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) is an enzyme that makes bacteria
  resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotic drugs. This is because it can
  inactivate most beta-lactam antibiotic drugs by hydrolyzing them. For in-depth understanding
  of the hydrolysis mechanism, the three-dimensional structure of NDM-1 was developed.
  With such a structural frame, two enzyme-ligand complexes were derived by respectively
  docking Imipenem and Meropenem (two typical beta-lactam antibiotic drugs) to the
  NDM-1 receptor. It was revealed from the NDM-1/Imipenem complex that the antibiotic
  drug was hydrolyzed while sitting in a binding pocket of NDM-1 formed by nine residues.
  And for the case of NDM-1/Meropenem complex, the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed
  in a binding pocket formed by twelve residues. All these constituent residues of
  the two binding pockets were explicitly defined and graphically labeled. It is anticipated
  that the findings reported here may provide useful insights for developing new antibiotic
  drugs to overcome the resistance problem. o̧pyright 2011 Wang, Chou.
