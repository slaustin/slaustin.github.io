abstract: Dynamic or structurally induced ionization is a critical aspect of many
  physical, chemical, and biological processes. Molecular dynamics (MD) based simulation
  approaches, specifically constant pH MD methods, have been developed to simulate
  ionization states of molecules or proteins under experimentally or physiologically
  relevant conditions. While such approaches are now widely utilized to predict ionization
  sites of macromolecules or to study physical or biological phenomena, they are often
  computationally expensive and require long simulation times to converge. In this
  article, using the principles of adiabatic free energy dynamics, we introduce an
  efficient technique for performing constant pH MD simulations within the framework
  of the adiabatic free energy dynamics (AFED) approach. We call the new approach
  pH-AFED. We show that pH-AFED provides highly accurate predictions of protein residue
  pKa values, with a MUE of 0.5 pKa units when coupled with driven adiabatic free
  energy dynamics (d-AFED), while reducing the required simulation times by more than
  an order of magnitude. In addition, pH-AFED can be easily integrated into most constant
  pH MD codes or implementations and flexibly adapted to work in conjunction with
  enhanced sampling algorithms that target collective variables. We demonstrate that
  our approaches, with both pH-AFED standalone as well as pH-AFED combined with collective
  variable based enhanced sampling, provide promising predictive accuracy, with a
  MUE of 0.6 and 0.5 pKa units respectively, on a diverse range of proteins and enzymes,
  ranging up to 186 residues and 21 titratable sites. Lastly, we demonstrate how this
  approach can be utilized to understand the in vivo performance engineered antibodies
  for immunotherapy.
