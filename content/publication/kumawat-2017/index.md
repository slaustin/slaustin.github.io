abstract: Allosteric effect implies ligand binding at one site leading to structural
  and/or dynamical changes at a distant site. PDZ domains are classic examples of
  dynamic allostery without conformational changes, where distal side-chain dynamics
  is modulated on ligand binding and the origin has been attributed to entropic effects.
  In this work, we unearth the energetic basis of the observed dynamic allostery in
  a PDZ3 domain protein using molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that
  electrostatic interaction provides a highly sensitive yardstick to probe the allosteric
  modulation in contrast to the traditionally used structure-based parameters. There
  is a significant population shift in the hydrogen-bonded network and salt bridges
  involving side chains on ligand binding. The ligand creates a local energetic perturbation
  that propagates in the form of dominolike changes in interresidue interaction pattern.
  There are significant changes in the nature of specific interactions (nonpolar/
  polar) between interresidue contacts and accompanied side-chain reorientations that
  drive the major redistribution of energy. In-terestingly, this internal redistribution
  and rewiring of side-chain interactions led to large cancellations resulting in
  small change in the overall enthalpy of the protein, thus making it difficult to
  detect experimentally. In contrast to the prevailing focus on the entropic or dynamic
  effects, we show that the internal redistribution and population shift in specific
  electrostatic interactions drive the allosteric modulation in the PDZ3 domain protein.
