abstract: This study introduces a novel method named multiple parameter replica exchange
  Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (MP-Rex-GaMD), building on the Gaussian
  accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) algorithm. GaMD enhances sampling and retrieves
  free energy information for biomolecular systems by adding a harmonic boost potential
  to smooth the potential energy surface without the need for predefined reaction
  coordinates. Our innovative approach advances the acceleration power and energetic
  reweighting accuracy of GaMD by incorporating a replica exchange algorithm that
  enables the exchange of multiple parameters, including the GaMD boost parameters
  of force constant and energy threshold, as well as temperature. Applying MP-Rex-GaMD
  to the three model systems of dialanine, chignolin, and HIV protease, we demonstrate
  its superior capability over conventional molecular dynamics and GaMD simulations
  in exploring protein conformations and effectively navigating various biomolecular
  states across energy barriers. MP-Rex-GaMD allows users to accurately map free energy
  landscapes through energetic reweighting, capturing the ensemble of biomolecular
  states from low-energy conformations to rare high-energy transitions within practical
  computational time scales.
