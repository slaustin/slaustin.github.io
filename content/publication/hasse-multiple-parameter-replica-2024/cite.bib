 abstract = {This study introduces a novel method named multiple parameter replica exchange Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (MP-Rex-GaMD), building on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) algorithm. GaMD enhances sampling and retrieves free energy information for biomolecular systems by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth the potential energy surface without the need for predefined reaction coordinates. Our innovative approach advances the acceleration power and energetic reweighting accuracy of GaMD by incorporating a replica exchange algorithm that enables the exchange of multiple parameters, including the GaMD boost parameters of force constant and energy threshold, as well as temperature. Applying MP-Rex-GaMD to the three model systems of dialanine, chignolin, and HIV protease, we demonstrate its superior capability over conventional molecular dynamics and GaMD simulations in exploring protein conformations and effectively navigating various biomolecular states across energy barriers. MP-Rex-GaMD allows users to accurately map free energy landscapes through energetic reweighting, capturing the ensemble of biomolecular states from low-energy conformations to rare high-energy transitions within practical computational time scales.},
