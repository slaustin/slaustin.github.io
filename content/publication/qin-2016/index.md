abstract: Protein hydration is essential to its structure, dynamics, and function,
  but water--protein interactions have not been directly observed in real time at
  physiological temperature to our awareness. By using a tryptophan scan with femtosecond
  spectroscopy, we simultaneously measured the hydration water dynamics and protein
  side-chain motions with temperature dependence. We observed the heterogeneous hydration
  dynamics around the global protein surface with two types of coupled motions, collective
  water/side-chain reorientation in a few picoseconds and cooperative water/side-chain
  restructuring in tens of picoseconds. The ultrafast dynamics in hundreds of femtoseconds
  is from the outer-layer, bulk-type mobile water molecules in the hydration shell.
  We also found that the hydration water dynamics are always faster than protein side-chain
  relaxations but with the same energy barriers, indicating hydration shell fluctuations
  driving protein side-chain motions on the picosecond time scales and thus elucidating
  their ultimate relationship.
