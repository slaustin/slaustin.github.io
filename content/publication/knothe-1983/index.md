abstract: In conjugational crosses, three Klebsiella pneumoniae strains and one Serratia
  marcescens strain have been demonstrated to transfer resistance determinants to
  newer types of cephalosporins. While Klebsiella strains donated cefotaxime, cefamandole
  and cefuroxime resistance to Escherichia coli K-12 recipients, the genetic analysis
  of exconjugants after the transfer of plasmids from Serratia strains to Proteus
  or Salmonella recipients showed that the cefoxitin resistance determinant was also
  co-transferred. In subsequent transfer cycles of this plasmid, cefotaxime and cefoxitin
  resistance determinants segregated in contrast to the relative stability of plasmids
  derived from Klebsiella strains in subsequent transfer cycles. From results obtained
  in this study, it may be concluded that in some strains of nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae,
  resistance to newer cephalosporins could be transmissible and thus plasmid-located.
