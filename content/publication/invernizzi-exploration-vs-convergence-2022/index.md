abstract: In adaptive-bias enhanced sampling methods, a bias potential is added to
  the system to drive transitions between metastable states. The bias potential is
  a function of a few collective variables and is gradually modified according to
  the underlying free energy surface. We show that when the collective variables are
  suboptimal, there is an exploration--convergence tradeoff, and one must choose between
  a quickly converging bias that will lead to fewer transitions or a slower to converge
  bias that can explore the phase space more efficiently but might require a much
  longer time to produce an accurate free energy estimate. The recently proposed on-the-fly
  probability enhanced sampling (OPES) method focuses on fast convergence, but there
  are cases where fast exploration is preferred instead. For this reason, we introduce
  a new variant of the OPES method that focuses on quickly escaping metastable states
  at the expense of convergence speed. We illustrate the benefits of this approach
  in prototypical systems and show that it outperforms the popular metadynamics method.
