abstract: The orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) method, which enables synchronous
  acceleration of the motions of a focused region and its coupled environment, was
  recently introduced to enhance sampling for free energy simulations. In the present
  work, the OSRW algorithm is generalized to be the orthogonal space tempering (OST)
  method via the introduction of the orthogonal space sampling temperature. Moreover,
  a double-integration recursion method is developed to enable practically efficient
  and robust OST free energy calculations, and the algorithm is augmented by a novel
  θ-dynamics approach to realize both the uniform sampling of order parameter spaces
  and rigorous end point constraints. In the present work, the double-integration
  OST method is employed to perform alchemical free energy simulations, specifically
  to calculate the free energy difference between benzyl phosphonate and difluorobenzyl
  phosphonate in aqueous solution, to estimate the solvation free energy of the octanol
  molecule, and to predict the nontrivial Barnase-Barstar binding affinity change
  induced by the Barnase N58A mutation. As demonstrated in these model studies, the
  DI-OST method can robustly enable practically efficient free energy predictions,
  particularly when strongly coupled slow environmental transitions are involved.
