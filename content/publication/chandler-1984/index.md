abstract: 'In this paper we develop a theory for an excess electron in simple fluids.
  It is based upon the path integral formulation of quantum theory which maps the
  behavior of the electron on to that of a classical isomorphic polymer. The influence
  functional, i.e., the solvent induced potential between different sites on the polymer,
  is estimated from the RISM integral equation. The functional is not pair decomposable
  and the resulting polymer problem is not trivial to solve. The evaluation of the
  electron partition function and correlation functions is pursued with two approximations:
  (i) a mean field approximation which neglects the role of polymer fluctuations on
  the solvent induced interactions: (ii) a polaron approximation which is a linear
  approximation in the sense that it neglects large fluctuations in the polymer structure
  itself. The theory brings to light a new approach to the computation of multiparticle
  correlation functions in fluids, and the theory provides what appears to be a practical
  scheme for...'
