abstract: Motivation An important step in structure-based drug design consists in
  the prediction of druggable binding sites. Several algorithms for detecting binding
  cavities, those likely to bind to a small drug compound, have been developed over
  the years by clever exploitation of geometric, chemical and evolutionary features
  of the protein. Results Here we present a novel knowledge-based approach that uses
  state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, where the algorithm is learned by
  examples. In total, 7622 proteins from the scPDB database of binding sites have
  been evaluated using both a distance and a volumetric overlap approach. Our machine-learning
  based method demonstrates superior performance to two other competitive algorithmic
  strategies.
