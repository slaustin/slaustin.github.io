abstract: Folded proteins can exist in multiple conformational substates. Each substate
  reflects a local minimum on the free-energy landscape with a distinct structure.
  By using ultrafast 2D-IR vibrational echo chemical-exchange spectroscopy, conformational
  switching between two well defined substates of a myoglobin mutant is observed on
  the $≈$50-ps time scale. The conformational dynamics are directly measured through
  the growth of cross peaks in the 2D-IR spectra of CO bound to the heme active site.
  The conformational switching involves motion of the distal histidine/E helix that
  changes the location of the imidazole side group of the histidine. The exchange
  between substates changes the frequency of the CO, which is detected by the time
  dependence of the 2D-IR vibrational echo spectrum. These results demonstrate that
  interconversion between protein conformational substates can occur on very fast
  time scales. The implications for larger structural changes that occur on much longer
  time scales are discussed. o̧pyright 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of
