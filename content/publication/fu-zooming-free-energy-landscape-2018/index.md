abstract: A robust importance-sampling algorithm for mapping free-energy surfaces
  over geometrical variables, coined meta-eABF, is introduced. This algorithm shaves
  the free-energy barriers and floods valleys by incorporating a history-dependent
  potential term in the extended adaptive biasing force (eABF) framework. Numerical
  applications on both toy models and nontrivial examples indicate that meta-eABF
  explores the free-energy surface significantly faster than either eABF or metadynamics
  (MtD) alone, without the need to stratify the reaction pathway. In some favorable
  cases, meta-eABF can be as much as five times faster than other importance-sampling
  algorithms. Many of the shortcomings inherent to eABF and MtD, like kinetic trapping
  in regions of configurational space already adequately sampled, the requirement
  of prior knowledge of the free-energy landscape to set up the simulation, are readily
  eliminated in meta-eABF. Meta-eABF, therefore, represents an appealing solution
  for a broad range of applications, especially when both eABF and MtD fail to achieve
  the desired result.
