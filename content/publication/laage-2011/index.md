abstract: The reorientation of a water molecule is important for a host of phenomena,
  ranging over--in an only partial listing--the key dynamic hydrogen-bond network
  restructuring of water itself, aqueous solution chemical reaction mechanisms and
  rates, ion transport in aqueous solution and membranes, protein folding, and enzymatic
  activity. This review focuses on water reorientation and related dynamics in pure
  water, and for aqueous solutes with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and amphiphilic character,
  ranging from tetra-methylurea to halide ions and amino acids. Attention is given
  to the application of theory, simulation, and experiment in the probing of these
  dynamics, in usefully describing them, and in assessing the description. Special
  emphasis is placed on a novel sudden, large-amplitude jump mechanism for water reorientation,
  which contrasts with the commonly assumed Debye rotational diffusion mechanism,
  characterized by small-amplitude angular motion. Some open questions and directions
  for further research are also discussed.
