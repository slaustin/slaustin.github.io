 abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a severe infectious disease in need of new chemotherapies especially for drug-resistant cases. To meet the urgent requirement of new TB drugs with novel modes of action, the TB research community has been validating numerous targets from several biosynthetic pathways. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is utilized by Mtb for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the universal five-carbon building blocks of isoprenoids. While being a common biosynthetic pathway in pathogens, the MEP pathway is completely absent in humans. Due to its unique presence in pathogens as well as the essentiality of the MEP pathway in Mtb, the enzymes in this pathway are promising targets for the development of new drugs against tuberculosis. In this Review, we discuss three enzymes in the MEP pathway: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5phosphate reductoisomerase (IspC/DXR), and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF), which appear to be the most promising antitubercular drug targets. Structural and mechanistic features of these enzymes are reviewed, as well as selected inhibitors that show promise as antitubercular agents.},
