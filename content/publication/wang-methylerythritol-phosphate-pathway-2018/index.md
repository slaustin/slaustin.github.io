abstract: 'Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a severe
  infectious disease in need of new chemotherapies especially for drug-resistant cases.
  To meet the urgent requirement of new TB drugs with novel modes of action, the TB
  research community has been validating numerous targets from several biosynthetic
  pathways. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is utilized by Mtb for the
  biosynthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
  (DMAPP), the universal five-carbon building blocks of isoprenoids. While being a
  common biosynthetic pathway in pathogens, the MEP pathway is completely absent in
  humans. Due to its unique presence in pathogens as well as the essentiality of the
  MEP pathway in Mtb, the enzymes in this pathway are promising targets for the development
  of new drugs against tuberculosis. In this Review, we discuss three enzymes in the
  MEP pathway: 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5phosphate
  reductoisomerase (IspC/DXR), and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase
  (IspF), which appear to be the most promising antitubercular drug targets. Structural
  and mechanistic features of these enzymes are reviewed, as well as selected inhibitors
  that show promise as antitubercular agents.'
