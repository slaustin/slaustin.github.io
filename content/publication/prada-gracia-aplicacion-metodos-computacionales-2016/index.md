abstract: Developing a novel drug is a complex, risky, expensive and time-consuming
  venture. It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with
  a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion
  USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches.
  Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency
  of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial
  component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization,
  techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used
  in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs
  and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact
  over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In
  this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most
  representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are
  illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements
  in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with
  the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer
  drugs.
