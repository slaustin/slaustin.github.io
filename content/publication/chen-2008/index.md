abstract: 'Water plays a critical role in the structure and function of proteins;
  although the experimental properties of water around protein structures are not
  well understood. The water can be classified by the separation from the protein
  surface into bulk water and hydration water. Hydration water interacts closely with
  the protein and contributes to protein folding; stability and dynamics; as well
  as interacting with the bulk water. Water potential functions are often parameterized
  to fit bulk water properties because of the limited experimental data for hydration
  water. Therefore; the structural and energetic properties of the hydration water
  were assessed for 105 atomic resolution ($łeq$1.0 Å) protein crystal structures
  with a high level of hydration water by calculating the experimental water-protein
  radial distribution function or surface distribution function (SDF) and water radial
  distribution function (RDF). Two maxima are observed in SDF: the first maximum at
  a radius of 2.75 Å reflects first shell and hydrogen bond interactions between protein
  and water; the second maximum at 3.65 Å reflects second shell and van der Waals
  interactions between water and non-polar atoms of protein forming clathrate-hydrate-like
  structures. Thus; the two shells do not overlap. The RDF showed the features of
  liquid water rather than solid ice. The first and second maxima of RDF at 2.75 and
  4.5 Å; respectively; are the same as for bulk water; but the peaks are sharper indicating
  hydration water is more stable than bulk water. Both distribution functions are
  inversely correlated with the distribution of B factors (atomic thermal factors)
  for the waters; suggesting that the maxima reflect stable positions. Therefore;
  the average water structure near the protein surface has experimentally observable
  differences from bulk water. This analysis will help improve the accuracy for models
  of water on the protein surface by providing rigorous data for the effects of the
  apparent chemical potential of the water near a protein surface.'
