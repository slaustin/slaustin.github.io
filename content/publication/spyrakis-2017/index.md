abstract: The value of thoroughly understanding the thermodynamics specific to a drug
  discovery/design study is well known. Over the past decade, the crucial roles of
  water molecules in protein structure, function, and dynamics have also become increasingly
  appreciated. This Perspective explores water in the biological environment by adopting
  its point of view in such phenomena. The prevailing thermodynamic models of the
  past, where water was seen largely in terms of an entropic gain after its displacement
  by a ligand, are now known to be much too simplistic. We adopt a set of terminology
  that describes water molecules as being \"hot\" and \"cold\", which we have defined
  as being easy and difficult to displace, respectively. The basis of these designations,
  which involve both enthalpic and entropic water contributions, are explored in several
  classes of biomolecules and structural motifs. The hallmarks for characterizing
  water molecules are examined, and computational tools for evaluating water-centric
  thermodynamics are reviewed. This Perspective's summary features guidelines for
  exploiting water molecules in drug discovery.
