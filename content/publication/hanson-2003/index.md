abstract: The effects of amino acid replacements on the backbone dynamics of bovine
  pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) were examined using15N NMR relaxation experiments.
  Previous studies have shown that backbone amide groups within the trypsin-binding
  region of the wild-type protein undergo conformational exchange processes on the
  $μ$s time scale, and that replacement of Tyr35 with Gly greatly increases the number
  of backbone atoms involved in such motions. In order to determine whether these
  mutational effects are specific to the replacement of this residue with Gly, six
  additional replacements were examined in the present study. In two of these, Tyr35
  was replaced with either Ala or Leu, and the other four were single replacements
  of Tyr23, Phe33, Asn43 or Asn44, all of which are highly buried in the native structure
  and conserved in homologous proteins. The Y35A and Y35L mutants displayed dynamic
  properties very similar to those of the Y35G mutant, with the backbone segments
  including residues 10-19 and 32-44 undergoing motions revealed by enhanced15N transverse
  relaxation rates. On the other hand, the Y23L, N43G and N44A substitutions caused
  almost no detectable changes in backbone dynamics, on either the ns-ps or ms-$μ$s
  time scales, even though each of these replacements significantly destabilizes the
  native conformation. Replacement of Phe33 with Leu caused intermediate effects,
  with several residues that have previously been implicated in motions in the wild-type
  protein displaying enhanced transverse relaxation rates. These results demonstrate
  that destabilizing amino acid replacements can be accommodated in a native protein
  with dramatically different effects on conformational dynamics and that Tyr35 plays
  a particularly important role in defining the conformation of the trypsin-binding
  site of BPTI. o̧pyright 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
