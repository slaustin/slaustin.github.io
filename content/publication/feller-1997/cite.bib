 abstract = {A potential energy function for unsaturated hydrocarbons is proposed and is shown to agree well with experiment, using molecular dynamics simulations of a water/octene interface and a dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer. The simulation results verify most of the assumptions used in interpreting the DOPC experiments, but suggest a few that should be reconsidered. Comparisons with recent results of a simulation of a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer show that disorder is comparable, even though the temperature, hydration level, and surface area/lipid for DOPC are lower. These observations highlight the dramatic effects of unsaturation on bilayer structure.},
