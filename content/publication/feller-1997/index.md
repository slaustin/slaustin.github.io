abstract: A potential energy function for unsaturated hydrocarbons is proposed and
  is shown to agree well with experiment, using molecular dynamics simulations of
  a water/octene interface and a dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer. The
  simulation results verify most of the assumptions used in interpreting the DOPC
  experiments, but suggest a few that should be reconsidered. Comparisons with recent
  results of a simulation of a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipid bilayer
  show that disorder is comparable, even though the temperature, hydration level,
  and surface area/lipid for DOPC are lower. These observations highlight the dramatic
  effects of unsaturation on bilayer structure.
