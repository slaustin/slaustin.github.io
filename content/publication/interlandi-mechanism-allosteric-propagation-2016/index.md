abstract: "The bacterial adhesin FimH consists of an allosterically regulated mannose-binding
  lectin domain and a covalently linked inhibitory pilin domain. Under normal conditions,
  the two domains are bound to each other, and FimH interacts weakly with mannose.
  However, under tensile force, the domains separate and the lectin domain undergoes
  conformational changes that strengthen its bond with mannose. Comparison of the
  crystallographic structures of the low and the high affinity state of the lectin
  domain reveals conformational changes mainly in the regulatory inter-domain region,
  the mannose binding site and a large $β$ sheet that connects the two distally located
  regions. Here, molecular dynamics simulations investigated how conformational changes
  are propagated within and between different regions of the lectin domain. It was
  found that the inter-domain region moves towards the high affinity conformation
  as it becomes more compact and buries exposed hydrophobic surface after separation
  of the pilin domain. The mannose binding site was more rigid in the high affinity
  state, which prevented water penetration into the pocket. The large central $β$
  sheet demonstrated a soft spring-like twisting. Its twisting motion was moderately
  correlated to fluctuations in both the regulatory and the binding region, whereas
  a weak correlation was seen in a direct comparison of these two distal sites. The
  results suggest a so called ``population shift'' model whereby binding of the lectin
  domain to either the pilin domain or mannose locks the $β$ sheet in a rather twisted
  or flat conformation, stabilizing the low or the high affinity state, respectively.
