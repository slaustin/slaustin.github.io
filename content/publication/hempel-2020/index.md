abstract: Proteins often have multiple switching domains that are coupled to each
  other and to the binding of ligands in order to realize signaling functions. Here
  we investigate the C2A domain of Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1), a calcium sensor in the
  neurotransmitter release machinery and a model system for the large family of C2
  membrane binding domains. We combine extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
  with Markov modeling in order to model conformational switching domains, their states,
  and their dependence on bound calcium ions. Then, we use transfer entropy to characterize
  how the switching domains are coupled via directed or allosteric mechanisms and
  give rise to the calcium sensing function of the protein. Our proposed switching
  mechanism contributes to the understanding of the neurotransmitter release machinery.
  Furthermore, the methodological approach we develop serves as a template to analyze
  conformational switching domains and the broad study of their coupling in macromolecular
  machines.
