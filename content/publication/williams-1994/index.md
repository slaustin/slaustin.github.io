abstract: We have analyzed the buried water molecules and internal cavities in a set
  of 75 high-resolution, nonhomologous, monomeric protein structures. The number of
  hydrogen bonds formed between each water molecule and the protein varies from 0
  to 4, with 3 being most common. Nearly half of the water molecules are found in
  pairs or larger clusters. Approximately 90% are shown to be associated with large
  cavities within the protein, as determined by a novel program, PRO_ACT. The total
  volume of a protein's large cavities is proportional to its molecular weight and
  is not dependent on structural class. The largest cavities in proteins are generally
  elongated rather than globular. There are many more empty cavities than hydrated
  cavities. The likelihood of a cavity being occupied by a water molecule increases
  with cavity size and the number of available hydrogen bond partners, with each additional
  partner typically stabilizing the occupied state by 0.6 kcal/mol. Copyright oÌ§pyright
