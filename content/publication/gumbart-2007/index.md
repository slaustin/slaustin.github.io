abstract: With recent advances in X-ray crystallography of membrane proteins promising
  many new high- resolution structures, MD simulations become increasingly valuable
  for understanding membrane protein function, as they can unleash dynamic behavior
  concealed in the static structures. Dramatic increase in computational power in
  synergy with more efficient computational methodologies allows one today to carry
  out molecular dynamics simulations of any structurally known membrane protein in
  its native environment, covering the time scale of up to 0.1 $Î¼$sec. At the frontier
  of membrane protein simulations are ion channels, aquaporins, passive and active
  transporters, and bioenergetic proteins. In this review we summarize recent developments
  in this rapidly evolving field.
