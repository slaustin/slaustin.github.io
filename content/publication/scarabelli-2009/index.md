abstract: Flavonoids exhibit a variety of beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases.
  Although their therapeutic properties have been attributed mainly to their antioxidant
  action, they have additional protective mechanisms such as inhibition of signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) activation. Here, we have investigated
  the cardioprotective mechanisms of strong antioxidant flavonoids such as quercetin,
  myricetin and delphinidin. Although all of them protect the heart from ischemia/reperfusion-injury,
  myricetin and delphinidin exert a more pronounced protective action than quercetin
  by their capacity to inhibit STAT1 activation. Biochemical and computer modeling
  analysis indicated the direct interaction between STAT1 and flavonoids with anti-STAT1
  activity. oÌ§pyright 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.
