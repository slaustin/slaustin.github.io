abstract: Standard normal mode analysis becomes problematic for complex molecular
  systems, as a result of both the high computational cost and the excessive amount
  of information when the full Hessian matrix is used. Several partial Hessian methods
  have been proposed in the literature, yielding approximate normal modes. These methods
  aim at reducing the computational load and/or calculating only the relevant normal
  modes of interest in a specific application. Each method has its own (dis)advantages
  and application field but guidelines for the most suitable choice are lacking. We
  have investigated several partial Hessian methods, including the Partial Hessian
  Vibrational Analysis (PHVA), the Mobile Block Hessian (MBH), and the Vibrational
  Subsystem Analysis (VSA). In this article, we focus on the benefits and drawbacks
  of these methods, in terms of the reproduction of localized modes, collective modes,
  and the performance in partially optimized structures. We find that the PHVA is
  suitable for describing localized modes, that the MBH not only reproduces localized
  and global modes but also serves as an analysis tool of the spectrum, and that the
  VSA is mostly useful for the reproduction of the low frequency spectrum. These guidelines
  are illustrated with the reproduction of the localized amine-stretch, the spectrum
  of quinine and a bis-cinchona derivative, and the low frequency modes of the LAO
  binding protein. oÌ§pyright 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
