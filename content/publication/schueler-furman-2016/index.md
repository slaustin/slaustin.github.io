abstract: Allosteric regulation plays a key role in many biological processes, such
  as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and many more. It is rooted
  in fundamental thermodynamic and dynamic properties of macromolecular systems that
  are still poorly understood and are moreover modulated by the cellular context.
  Here we review the computational approaches used in the investigation of allosteric
  processes in protein systems. We outline how the models of allostery have evolved
  from their initial formulation in the sixties to the current views, which more fully
  account for the roles of the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the system.
  We then describe the major classes of computational approaches employed to elucidate
  the mechanisms of allostery, the insights they have provided, as well as their limitations.
  We complement this analysis by highlighting the role of computational approaches
  in promising practical applications, such as the engineering of regulatory modules
  and identifying allosteric binding sites.
