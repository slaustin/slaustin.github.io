abstract: Water is an essential participant in the stability, structure, dynamics,
  and function of proteins and other biomolecules. Thermodynamically, changes in the
  aqueous environment affect the stability of biomolecules. Structurally, water participates
  chemically in the catalytic function of proteins and nucleic acids and physically
  in the collapse of the protein chain during folding through hydrophobic collapse
  and mediates binding through the hydrogen bond in complex formation. Water is a
  partner that slaves the dynamics of proteins, and water interaction with proteins
  affect their dynamics. Here we provide a review of the experimental and computational
  advances over the past decade in understanding the role of water in the dynamics,
  structure, and function of proteins. We focus on the combination of X-ray and neutron
  crystallography, NMR, terahertz spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, thermodynamics,
  and computer simulations to reveal how water assist proteins in their function.
  The recent advances in computer simulations and the enhanced sensitivity of experimental
  tools promise major advances in the understanding of protein dynamics, and water
  surely will be a protagonist.
