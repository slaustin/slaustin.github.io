abstract: There is an accelerating interest in practical applications of alchemical
  free energy methods to problems in protein design, constant pH simulations, and
  especially computer-aided drug design. In the present paper, we describe a basic
  lambda dynamics engine (BLaDE) that enables alchemical free energy simulations,
  including multisite $łambda$ dynamics (MS$łambda$D) simulations, on graphical processor
  units (GPUs). We find that BLaDE is 5 to 8 times faster than the current GPU implementation
  of MS$łambda$D-based free energy calculations in CHARMM. We also demonstrate that
  BLaDE running standard molecular dynamics attains a performance competitive with
  and sometimes exceeding that of the highly optimized OpenMM GPU code. BLaDE is available
  as a standalone program and through an API in CHARMM.
