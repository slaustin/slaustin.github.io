 abstract = {Many proteins in their unbound structures have cryptic sites that are not appropriately sized for drug binding. We consider here 32 proteins from the recently published CryptoSite set with validated cryptic sites, and study whether the sites remain cryptic in all available X-ray structures of the proteins solved without any ligand bound near the sites. It was shown that only few of these proteins have binding pockets that never form without ligand binding. Sites that are cryptic in some structures but spontaneously form in others are also rare. In most proteins the forming of pockets is affected by mutations or ligand binding at locations far from the cryptic site. To further explore these mechanisms, we applied adiabatic biased molecular dynamics simulations to guide the proteins from their ligand-free structures to ligand-bound conformations, and studied the distribution of druggability scores of the pockets located at the cryptic sites.},
