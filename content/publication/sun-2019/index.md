abstract: Many proteins in their unbound structures have cryptic sites that are not
  appropriately sized for drug binding. We consider here 32 proteins from the recently
  published CryptoSite set with validated cryptic sites, and study whether the sites
  remain cryptic in all available X-ray structures of the proteins solved without
  any ligand bound near the sites. It was shown that only few of these proteins have
  binding pockets that never form without ligand binding. Sites that are cryptic in
  some structures but spontaneously form in others are also rare. In most proteins
  the forming of pockets is affected by mutations or ligand binding at locations far
  from the cryptic site. To further explore these mechanisms, we applied adiabatic
  biased molecular dynamics simulations to guide the proteins from their ligand-free
  structures to ligand-bound conformations, and studied the distribution of druggability
  scores of the pockets located at the cryptic sites.
