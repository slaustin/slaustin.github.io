abstract: Protein conformation has been recognized as the key feature determining
  biological function, as it determines the position of the essential groups specifically
  interacting with substrates. Hence, the shape of the cavities or grooves at the
  protein surface appears to drive those functions. However, only a few studies describe
  the geometrical evolution of protein cavities during molecular dynamics simulations
  (MD), usually with a crude representation. To unveil the dynamics of cavity geometry
  evolution, we developed an approach combining cavity detection and Principal Component
  Analysis (PCA). This approach was applied to four systems subjected to MD (lysozyme,
  sperm whale myoglobin, Dengue envelope protein and EF-CaM complex). PCA on cavities
  allows us to perform efficient analysis and classification of the geometry diversity
  explored by a cavity. Additionally, it reveals correlations between the evolutions
  of the cavities and structures, and can even suggest how to modify the protein conformation
  to induce a given cavity geometry. It also helps to perform fast and consensual
  clustering of conformations according to cavity geometry. Finally, using this approach,
  we show that both carbon monoxide (CO) location and transfer among the different
  xenon sites of myoglobin are correlated with few cavity evolution modes of high
  amplitude. This correlation illustrates the link between ligand diffusion and the
  dynamic network of internal cavities.
