abstract: The thermodynamics hypothesis, casually referred to as ``Anfinsen's dogma,''
  is described theoretically in terms of a concept of the structural fluctuation of
  protein or the first moment (average structure) and the second moment (variance
  and covariance) of the structural distribution. The new theoretical concept views
  the unfolding and refolding processes of protein as a shift of the structural distribution
  induced by a thermodynamic perturbation, with the variance-covariance matrix varying.
  Based on the theoretical concept, a method to characterize the mechanism of folding
  (or unfolding) is proposed. The transition state, if any, between two stable states
  is interpreted as a gap in the distribution, which is created due to an extensive
  reorganization of hydrogen bonds among back-bone atoms of protein and with water
  molecules in the course of conformational change. Further perspective to applying
  the theory to the computer-aided drug design, and to the material science, is briefly
  discussed.
