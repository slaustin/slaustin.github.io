abstract: Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disease characterized
  by accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in lysosomes. Here
  we report the 1.7-Å resolution crystal structure of the cholesterol-binding protein
  deficient in this disease, NPC2, and the characterization of its ligand binding
  properties. Human NPC2 binds the cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol with submicromolar
  affinity at both acidic and neutral pH. NPC2 has an Ig-like fold stabilized by three
  disulfide bonds. The structure of the bovine protein reveals a loosely packed region
  penetrating from the surface into the hydrophobic core that forms adjacent small
  cavities with a total volume of $≈$160 Å3. We propose that this region represents
  the incipient cholesterol-binding site that dilates to accommodate an $≈$740-Å3
  cholesterol molecule.
