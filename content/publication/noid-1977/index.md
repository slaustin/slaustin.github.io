abstract: Vibrational classical trajectories of anharmonic molecules are used here
  to obtain the classical vibrational autocorrelation function and, via a Fourier
  transform, the power (or infrared) spectrum of the dynamical variables. In the vibrationally
  quasiperiodic regime the spectrum consists of sharp lines, for any given initial
  amplitude. The initial amplitudes are chosen semiclassically. The spectral lines
  are compared with quantum mechanical calculations for systems with two and three
  coordinates, with excellent agreement. The method is also useful for obtaining a
  classical spectrum in the ergodic regime; the spectral lines are then ''broad''
  rather than narrow. The method can be used in the analysis of trajectories for unimolecular
  reactions, infrared multiphoton dissociations, and for obtaining molecular spectra
  from force fields. The spectralanalysis itself has implications for the theory of
  unimolecular reactions.
