abstract: BACKGROUND Infective endocarditis is a potentially lethal disease that has
  undergone major changes in both host and pathogen. The epidemiology of infective
  endocarditis has become more complex with today's myriad healthcare-associated factors
  that predispose to infection. Moreover, changes in pathogen prevalence, in particular
  a more common staphylococcal origin, have affected outcomes, which have not improved
  despite medical and surgical advances. METHODS AND RESULTS This statement updates
  the 2005 iteration, both of which were developed by the American Heart Association
  under the auspices of the Committee on Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki
  Disease, Council on Cardiovascular Disease of the Young. It includes an evidenced-based
  system for diagnostic and treatment recommendations used by the American College
  of Cardiology and the American Heart Association for treatment recommendations.
  CONCLUSIONS Infective endocarditis is a complex disease, and patients with this
  disease generally require management by a team of physicians and allied health providers
  with a variety of areas of expertise. The recommendations provided in this document
  are intended to assist in the management of this uncommon but potentially deadly
  infection. The clinical variability and complexity in infective endocarditis, however,
  dictate that these recommendations be used to support and not supplant decisions
  in individual patient management.
