abstract: Enhanced-sampling algorithms relying on collective variables (CVs) are extensively
  employed to study complex (bio)chemical processes that are not amenable to brute-force
  molecular simulations. The selection of appropriate CVs characterizing the slow
  movement modes is of paramount importance for reliable and efficient enhanced-sampling
  simulations. In this Perspective, we first review the application and limitations
  of CVs obtained from chemical and geometrical intuition. We also introduce path-sampling
  algorithms, which can identify path-like CVs in a high-dimensional free-energy space.
  Machine-learning algorithms offer a viable approach to finding suitable CVs by analyzing
  trajectories from preliminary simulations. We discuss both the performance of machine-learning-derived
  CVs in enhanced-sampling simulations of experimental models and the challenges involved
  in applying these CVs to realistic, complex molecular assemblies. Moreover, we provide
  a prospective view of the potential advancements of machine-learning algorithms
  for the development of CVs in the field of enhanced-sampling simulations.
