 abstract = {Enhanced-sampling algorithms relying on collective variables (CVs) are extensively employed to study complex (bio)chemical processes that are not amenable to brute-force molecular simulations. The selection of appropriate CVs characterizing the slow movement modes is of paramount importance for reliable and efficient enhanced-sampling simulations. In this Perspective, we first review the application and limitations of CVs obtained from chemical and geometrical intuition. We also introduce path-sampling algorithms, which can identify path-like CVs in a high-dimensional free-energy space. Machine-learning algorithms offer a viable approach to finding suitable CVs by analyzing trajectories from preliminary simulations. We discuss both the performance of machine-learning-derived CVs in enhanced-sampling simulations of experimental models and the challenges involved in applying these CVs to realistic, complex molecular assemblies. Moreover, we provide a prospective view of the potential advancements of machine-learning algorithms for the development of CVs in the field of enhanced-sampling simulations.},
