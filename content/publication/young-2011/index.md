abstract: 'We review the concepts of protein dynamics developed over the last 35 years
  and extend applications of the unified model of protein dynamics to heat flow and
  spatial fluctuations in hydrated myoglobin (Mb) powders. Differential scanning calorimetry
  (DSC) and incoherent neutron scattering (INS) data on hydration Mb powders are explained
  by the temperature-dependence of the hydration-shell $β$ h process measured by dielectric
  relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). The unified model explains the temperature dependence
  of DSC and INS data as a kinetic effect due to a fixed experimental time window
  and a broad distribution of hydration-shell $β$ h fluctuation rates. We review the
  slaving of large scale protein motions to the bulk solvent $α$ process, and the
  metastability of Mb molecules in glass forming bulk solvent at low temperatures.
