 abstract = {We review the concepts of protein dynamics developed over the last 35 years and extend applications of the unified model of protein dynamics to heat flow and spatial fluctuations in hydrated myoglobin (Mb) powders. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and incoherent neutron scattering (INS) data on hydration Mb powders are explained by the temperature-dependence of the hydration-shell $β$ h process measured by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). The unified model explains the temperature dependence of DSC and INS data as a kinetic effect due to a fixed experimental time window and a broad distribution of hydration-shell $β$ h fluctuation rates. We review the slaving of large scale protein motions to the bulk solvent $α$ process, and the metastability of Mb molecules in glass forming bulk solvent at low temperatures.
