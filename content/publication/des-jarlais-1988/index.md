abstract: Finding novel leads from which to design drug molecules has traditionally
  been a matter of screening and serendipity. We present a method for finding a wide
  assortment of chemical structures that are complementary to the shape of a macromoleculer
  receptor site whose X-ray crystallographic structure is known. Each of a set of
  small molecules from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database (Allen; et al. J. Chem.
  Doc. 1973, 13, 119) is individually docked to the receptor in a number of geometrically
  permissible orientations with use of the docking algorithm developed by Kuntz et
  al. (J. Mol. Biol. 1982,161, 269). The orientations are evaluated for goodness-of-fit,
  and the best are kept for further examination using the molecular mechanics program
  amber (Weiner; Kollman J. Comput. Chem. 1981, 106, 765). The shape-search algorithm
  finds known ligands as well as novel molecules that fit the binding site being studied.
  The highest scoring orientations of known ligands resemble binding modes generated
  by interactive modeling or determined crystallographically. We describe the application
  of this procedure to the binding sites of papain and carbonic anhydrase. While the
  compounds recovered from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database are not, themselves,
  likely to be inhibitors or substrates of these enzymes, we expect that the structures
  from such searches will be useful in the design of active compounds. oÌ§pyright 1988,
