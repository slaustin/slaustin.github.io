abstract: The genomics revolution has provided a deluge of new targets for drug discovery.
  To facilitate the drug discovery process, many researchers are turning to fragment-based
  approaches to find lead molecules more efficiently. One such method, Tethering1,
  allows for the identification of small-molecule fragments that bind to specific
  regions of a protein target. These fragments can then be elaborated, combined with
  other molecules, or combined with one another to provide high-affinity drug leads.
  In this review we describe the background and theory behind Tethering and discuss
  its use in identifying novel inhibitors for protein targets including interleukin-2
  (IL-2), thymidylate synthase (TS), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), and
  caspases.
