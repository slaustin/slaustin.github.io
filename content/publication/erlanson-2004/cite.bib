 abstract = {The genomics revolution has provided a deluge of new targets for drug discovery. To facilitate the drug discovery process, many researchers are turning to fragment-based approaches to find lead molecules more efficiently. One such method, Tethering1, allows for the identification of small-molecule fragments that bind to specific regions of a protein target. These fragments can then be elaborated, combined with other molecules, or combined with one another to provide high-affinity drug leads. In this review we describe the background and theory behind Tethering and discuss its use in identifying novel inhibitors for protein targets including interleukin-2 (IL-2), thymidylate synthase (TS), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B), and caspases.},
