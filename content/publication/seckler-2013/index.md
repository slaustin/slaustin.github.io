abstract: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a critical drug target for HIV treatment,
  and understanding the exact mechanisms of its function and inhibition would significantly
  accelerate the development of new anti-HIV drugs. It is well known that structure
  plays a critical role in protein function, but for RT, structural information has
  proven to be insufficient-despite enormous effort-to explain the mechanism of inhibition
  and drug resistance of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors. We hypothesize that the missing
  link is dynamics, information about the motions of the system. However, many of
  the techniques that give the best information about dynamics, such as solution nuclear
  magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics simulations, cannot be easily applied
  to a protein as large as RT. As an alternative, we combine elastic network modeling
  with simultaneous hierarchical clustering of structural and dynamic data. We present
  an extensive survey of the dynamics of RT bound to a variety of ligands and with
  a number of mutations, revealing a novel mechanism for drug resistance to non-nucleoside
  RT inhibitors. Hydrophobic core mutations restore active-state motion to multiple
  functionally significant regions of HIV-1 RT. This model arises out of a combination
  of structural and dynamic information, rather than exclusively from one or the other.
