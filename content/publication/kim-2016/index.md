abstract: Water molecules in the immediate vicinity of biomacromolecules, including
  proteins, constitute a hydration layer characterized by physicochemical properties
  different from those of bulk water and play a vital role in the activity and stability
  of these structures, as well as in intermolecular interactions. Previous studies
  using solution scattering, crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations have
  provided valuable information about the properties of these hydration shells, including
  modifications in density and ionic concentration. Small-angle scattering of x-rays
  (SAXS) and neutrons (SANS) are particularly useful and complementary techniques
  to study biomacromolecular hydration shells due to their sensitivity to electronic
  and nuclear scattering-length density fluctuations, respectively. Although several
  sophisticated SAXS/SANS programs have been developed recently, the impact of physicochemical
  surface properties on the hydration layer remains controversial, and systematic
  experimental data from individual biomacromolecular systems are scarce. Here, we
  address the impact of physicochemical surface properties on the hydration shell
  by a systematic SAXS/SANS study using three mutants of a single protein, green fluorescent
  protein (GFP), with highly variable net charge (+36, -6, and -29). The combined
  analysis of our data shows that the hydration shell is locally denser in the vicinity
  of acidic surface residues, whereas basic and hydrophilic/hydrophobic residues only
  mildly modify its density. Moreover, the data demonstrate that the density modifications
  result from the combined effect of residue-specific recruitment of ions from the
  bulk in combination with water structural rearrangements in their vicinity. Finally,
  we find that the specific surface-charge distributions of the different GFP mutants
  modulate the conformational space of flexible parts of the protein.
