abstract: The solvation energy and entropy at infinite dilution consist of a solute?solvent
  term and a solvent reorganization term representing the contributions of changes
  in solvent structure upon solute insertion. In the standard, homogeneous treatment
  of solutions, changes in solvent structure are expressed through derivatives of
  the homogeneous pair correlation function, which are very difficult to obtain by
  simulation. Tractable expressions for the solvation energy and entropy are here
  derived by viewing the solution as an inhomogeneous system with the solute fixed
  at a certain point. The solvent reorganization terms in the inhomogeneous view contain
  two contributions:? the local, ?correlation? contributions, which are due to correlations
  between the solute and the solvent and dominate at high densities, and the nonlocal,
  ?liberation? contributions, which are due to the effective dilution of the solvent
  caused by the thermal motion of the solute and dominate at low densities. The liberation
  contributions are independent of the nature or size of the solute and depend only
  on the properties of the solvent. For common liquid solvents the nonlocal terms
  are negligible and the solvation properties arise almost entirely from effects localized
  around the solute. The new expressions are tested by calculations of the solvent
  reorganization energy and entropy in ideal hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones mixtures
  (solute identical to solvent). The solvent reorganization energy and entropy make
  distinct and significant contributions to the solvation free energy. The theory
  can be applied to truly inhomogeneous systems as well as small solute solvation,
  thus providing a connection between interfacial phenomena and microscopic solvation.
