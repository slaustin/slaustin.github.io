abstract: Ligand migration processes inside myoglobin and protein dynamics coupled
  to the migration were theoretically investigated with molecular dynamics simulations.
  Based on a linear response theory, we identified protein motions coupled to the
  transient migration of ligand, carbon monoxide (CO), through channels. The result
  indicates that the coupled protein motions involve collective motions extended over
  the entire protein correlated with local gating motions at the channels. Protein
  motions, coupled to opening of a channel from the distal pocket to a neighboring
  xenon site, were found to share the collective motion with experimentally observed
  protein motions coupled to a doming motion of the heme Fe atom upon photodissociation
  of the ligand. Analysis based on generalized Langevin dynamics elucidated slow and
  diffusive features of the protein response motions. Remarkably small transmission
  coefficients for rates of the CO migrations through myoglobin were found, suggesting
  that the CO migration dynamics are characterized as motions governed by the protein
  dynamics involving the collective motions, rather than as thermally activated transitions
  across energy barriers of well-structured channels. oÌ§pyright 2010 by the Biophysical
