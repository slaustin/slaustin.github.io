abstract: We have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous
  NaCl and KCl solutions at different concentrations to investigate the effects of
  ion atmosphere on the dynamics of water-water hydrogen bonds at room temperature.
  The average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule decreases with increase
  of ion concentration. The dynamics of hydrogen-bond breaking is found to accelerate
  somewhat and that of hydrogen-bond structural relaxation, which occurs at a longer
  time scale, is found to slow down with increasing ion concentration for both NaCl
  and KCl solutions.
