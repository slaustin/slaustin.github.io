 abstract = {We have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl and KCl solutions at different concentrations to investigate the effects of ion atmosphere on the dynamics of water-water hydrogen bonds at room temperature. The average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule decreases with increase of ion concentration. The dynamics of hydrogen-bond breaking is found to accelerate somewhat and that of hydrogen-bond structural relaxation, which occurs at a longer time scale, is found to slow down with increasing ion concentration for both NaCl and KCl solutions.},
