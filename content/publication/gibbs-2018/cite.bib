 abstract = {Dengue virus poses a significant global health threat as the source of increasingly deleterious dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. As no specific antiviral treatment exists for dengue infection, considerable effort is being applied to discover therapies and drugs for maintenance and prevention of these afflictions. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, and infection occurs following viral endocytosis by host cells. Upon entering the cell, viral RNA is translated into a large multisubunit polyprotein which is post-translationally cleaved into mature, structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. The viral genome encodes the enzyme to carry out cleavage of the large polyprotein, specifically the NS2B-NS3pro cofactor-protease complex---a target of high interest for drug design. One class of recently discovered NS2B-NS3pro inhibitors is the substrate-based trifluoromethyl ketone containing peptides. These compounds interact covalently with the active site Ser135 via a hemiketal adduct. A detailed picture of the intermolecular protease/inhibitor interactions of the hemiketal adduct is crucial for rational drug design. We demonstrate, through the use of protein- and ligand-detected solution-state \textsuperscript19F and \textsuperscript1H NMR methods, an unanticipated multibinding mode behavior of a representative of this class of inhibitors to dengue NS2B-NS3pro. Our results illustrate the highly dynamic nature of both the covalently bound ligand and protease protein structure, and the need to consider these dynamics when designing future inhibitors in this class.},
