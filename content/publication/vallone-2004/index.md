abstract: Neuroglobin, a recently discovered globin predominantly expressed in neuronal
  tissue of vertebrates, binds small, gaseous ligands at the sixth coordination position
  of the heme iron. In the absence of an exogenous ligand, the distal histidine (His64)
  binds to the heme iron in the ferrous and ferric states. The crystal structure of
  murine ferric (met) neuroglobin at 1.5 Å reveals interesting features relevant to
  the ligand binding mechanism. Only weak selectivity is observed for the two possible
  heme orientations, the occupancy ratio being 70:30. Two small internal cavities
  are present on the heme distal side, which enable the His64(E7) side chain to move
  out of the way upon exogenous ligand binding. Moreover, a third, huge cavity (volume
  approximately 290 Å3) connecting both sides of the heme, is open towards the exterior
  and provides a potential passageway for ligands. The CD and EF corners exhibit substantial
  flexibility, which may assist ligands in entering the protein and accessing the
  active site. Based on this high-resolution structure, further structure-function
  studies can be planned to elucidate the role of neuroglobin in physiological responses
  to hypoxia. o̧pyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
