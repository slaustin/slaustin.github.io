abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) can be used to relate the thermodynamic
  properties of solutions to the indirect solvent mediated part of the solute-solvent
  potential of mean force (PMF). Standard, but powerful numerical methods can be used
  to estimate the solute-solvent PMF from which the indirect part can be extracted.
  In this work we show how knowledge of the direct and indirect parts of the solute-solvent
  PMF for water at the interface of a protein receptor can be used to gain insights
  about how to design tighter binding ligands. As we show, the indirect part of the
  solute-solvent PMF is equal to the sum of the 1-body (energy + entropy) terms in
  the inhomogeneous solvation theory (IST) expansion of the solvation free energy.
  To illustrate the effect of displacing interfacial water molecules with particular
  direct/indirect PMF signatures on the binding of ligands, we carry out simulations
  of protein binding with several pairs of congeneric ligands. We show that interfacial
  water locations that contribute favorably or unfavorably at the 1-body level (energy
  + entropy) to the solvation free energy of the solute can be targeted as part of
  the ligand design process. Water locations where the indirect PMF is larger in magnitude
  provide better targets for displacement when adding a functional group to a ligand
  core.
