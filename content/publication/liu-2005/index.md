abstract: An innovative replica exchange (parallel tempering) method called replica
  exchange with solute tempering (REST) for the efficient sampling of aqueous protein
  solutions is presented here. The method bypasses the poor scaling with system size
  of standard replica exchange and thus reduces the number of replicas (parallel processes)
  that must be used. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function
  for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange
  of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules
  in the system. For proof of concept, REST is compared with standard replica exchange
  for an alanine dipeptide molecule in water. The comparisons confirm that REST greatly
  reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and increases the
  sampling efficiency. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic
  averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water. oÌ§pyright
