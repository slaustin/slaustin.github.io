abstract: 'Computational small-molecule binding site detection has several important
  applications in the biomedical field. Notable interests are the identification of
  cavities for structure-based drug discovery or functional annotation of structures.
  fpocket is a small-molecule pocket detection program, relying on the geometric $α$-sphere
  theory. The fpocket web server allows: (i) candidate pocket detection-fpocket; (ii)
  pocket tracking during molecular dynamics, in order to provide insights into pocket
  dynamics-mdpocket; and (iii) a transposition of mdpocket to the combined analysis
  of homologous structures-hpocket. These complementary online tools allow to tackle
  various questions related to the identification and annotation of functional and
  allosteric sites, transient pockets and pocket preservation within evolution of
  structural families. The server and documentation are freely available at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/fpocket.
