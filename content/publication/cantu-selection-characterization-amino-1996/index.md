abstract: Recently, natural variants of TEM-1 $β$-lactamase with amino acid substitutions
  at residues 237-240 have been identified that have increased hydrolytic activity
  for extended-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidime. To identify the sequence
  requirements in this region for a given antibiotic, a random library was constructed
  that contained all possible amino acid combinations for the 3-residue region 237-240
  (ABL numbering system) of TEM- 1 $β$-lactamase. An antibiotic disc diffusion method
  was used to select mutants with wild-type level activity or greater for the extended-spectrum
  cephalosporin ceftazidime and the monobactam aztreonam. Mutants that were selected
  for optimal ceftazidime hydrolysis contained a conserved Ala at position 237, a
  Ser for Gly substitution at position 238, and a Lys for Glu at position 240. Mutants
  selected for aztreonam hydrolysis exhibited a Gly for Ala substitution at position
  237, a Ser for Gly substitution at position 238, and a Lys/Arg for Glu at position
  240. The role of the A237G substitution in differentiating between ceftazidime and
  aztreonam was further investigated by kinetic analysis of the A237G, E240K, G238S:E240K,
  and A237G:G238S:E240K enzymes. The A237G single mutant and the G238S:E240K double
  mutant exhibited increases in catalytic efficiency for both ceftazidime and aztreonam.
  However, the triple mutant A237G:G238S:E240K, displayed a 12-fold decrease in catalytic
  efficiency for ceftazidime but a 3-fold increase for aztreonam relative to the G238S:E240K
  double mutant. Thus, the A237G substitution increases ceftazidime hydrolysis when
  present alone but antagonizes ceftazidime hydrolysis when it is combined with the
  G238S:E240K substitutions. In contrast, the A237G substitution acts additively with
  the G238S:E240K substitutions to increase aztreonam hydrolysis.
