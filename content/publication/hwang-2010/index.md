abstract: A series of halo-nitrobenzamide were synthesized and evaluated for their
  ability to block proliferation of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. A number of these compounds
  had significant activity against the parasite, particularly 2-chloro-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-nitrobenzamide
  17 which exhibited low micromolar inhibitory potency against T. brucei and selectivity
  towards both malaria and mammalian cells. oÌ§pyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
