 abstract = {A series of halo-nitrobenzamide were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to block proliferation of Trypanosoma brucei brucei. A number of these compounds had significant activity against the parasite, particularly 2-chloro-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-nitrobenzamide 17 which exhibited low micromolar inhibitory potency against T. brucei and selectivity towards both malaria and mammalian cells. oÌ§pyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
