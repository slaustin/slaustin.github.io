abstract: Receptor-based pharmacophore modeling is an efficient computer-aided drug
  design technique that uses the structure of the target protein to identify novel
  leads. However, most methods consider protein flexibility and desolvation effects
  in a very approximate way, which may limit their use in practice. The Site-Identification
  by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) assisted pharmacophore modeling protocol
  (SILCS-Pharm) was introduced recently to address these issues, as SILCS naturally
  takes both protein flexibility and desolvation effects into account by using full
  molecular dynamics simulations to determine 3D maps of the functional group-affinity
  patterns on a target receptor. In the present work, the SILCS-Pharm protocol is
  extended to use a wider range of probe molecules including benzene, propane, methanol,
  formamide, acetaldehyde, methylammonium, acetate and water. This approach removes
  the previous ambiguity brought by using water as both the hydrogen-bond donor and
  acceptor probe molecule. The new SILCS-Pharm protocol is shown to yield improved
  screening results, as compared to the previous approach based on three target proteins.
  Further validation of the new protocol using five additional protein targets showed
  improved screening compared to those using common docking methods, further indicating
  improvements brought by the explicit inclusion of additional feature types associated
  with the wider collection of probe molecules in the SILCS simulations. The advantage
  of using complementary features and volume constraints, based on exclusion maps
  of the protein defined from the SILCS simulations, is presented. In addition, reranking
  using SILCS-based ligand grid free energies is shown to enhance the diversity of
  identified ligands for the majority of targets. These results suggest that the SILCS-Pharm
  protocol will be of utility in rational drug design.
