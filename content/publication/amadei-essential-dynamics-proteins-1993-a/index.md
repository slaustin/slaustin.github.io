abstract: "Analysis of extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in
  vacuo and in aqueous solution reveals that it is possible to separate the configurational
  space into two subspaces: (1) an ``essential'' subspace containing only a few degrees
  of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that comprises most of the positional
  fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian
  distribution and which can be considered as ``physically constrained.'' If overall
  translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a
  simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid
  over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance
  matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe
  motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically
  constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint
  behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and
  promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and
  performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space. oÌ§pyright 1993 Wiley-Liss,
