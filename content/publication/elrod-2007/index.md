abstract: The recent discovery that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenously produced
  gaseous second messenger capable of modulating many physiological processes, much
  like nitric oxide, prompted us to investigate the potential of H2S as a cardioprotective
  agent. In the current study, we demonstrate that the delivery of H2S at the time
  of reperfusion limits infarct size and preserves left ventricular (LV) function
  in an in vivo model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI-R). This observed cytoprotection
  is associated with an inhibition of myocardial inflammation and a preservation of
  both mitochondrial structure and function after I-R injury. Additionally, we show
  that modulation of endogenously produced H2S by cardiac-specific overexpression
  of cystathionine $γ$-lyase ($α$-MHC-CGL-Tg mouse) significantly limits the extent
  of injury. These findings demonstrate that H2S may be of value in cytoprotection
  during the evolution of myocardial infarction and that either administration of
  H2S or the modulation of endogenous production may be of clinical benefit in ischemic
  disorders. o̧pyright 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.
