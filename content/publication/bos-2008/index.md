abstract: A set of 49 high-resolution ($łeq$2.2 Å) structures of the TEM, SHV, and
  CTX-M class A $β$-lactamase families was systematically analyzed to investigate
  the role of conserved water molecules in the stabilization of the textohm-loop.
  Overall, 13 water molecules were found to be conserved in at least 45 structures,
  including two water positions which were found to be conserved in all structures.
  Of the 13 conserved water molecules, 6 are located at the textohm-loop, forming
  a dense cluster with hydrogen bonds to residues at the textohm-loop as well as to
  the rest of the protein. This layer of conserved water molecules is packed between
  the textohm-loop and the rest of the protein and acts as structural glue, which
  could reduce the flexibility of the textohm-loop. A correlation between conserved
  water molecules and conserved protein residues could in general not be detected,
  with the exception of the conserved water molecules at the textohm-loop. Furthermore,
  the evolutionary relationship between the three families, derived from the number
  of conserved water molecules, is similar to the relationship derived from phylogenetic
  analysis. Copyright o̧pyright 2008, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights
