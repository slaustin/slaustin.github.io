abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations have proven to be a valuable tool to investigate
  the dynamic behavior of stable macromolecules at finite temperatures. However, considerable
  conformational transitions take place during a simulation only accidentally or at
  exceptionally high temperatures far from the range of experimental conditions. Targeted
  molecular dynamics (TMD) is a method to induce a conformational change to a known
  target structure at ordinary temperature by applying a time-dependent, purely geometrical
  constraint. The transition is enforced independently of the height of energy barriers,
  while the dynamics of the molecule is only minimally influenced by the constraint.
  Simulations of decaalanine and insulin show the ability of the method to explore
  the configurational space for pathways accessible at a given temperature. The transitions
  studied at insulin comprise unfolding of an $α$-helical portion and, in the reverse
  direction, refolding from an extended conformation. A possible application of TMD
  is the search for energy barriers and stable intermediates from rather local changes
  up to protein denaturation. o̧pyright 1994.
