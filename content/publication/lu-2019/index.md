abstract: Allosteric modulators bound to structurally diverse allosteric sites can
  achieve better pharmacological advantages than orthosteric ligands. The discovery
  of allosteric modulators, however, has been traditionally serendipitous, owing to
  the complex nature of allosteric modulation. Recent advances in the understanding
  of allosteric regulatory mechanisms and remarkable availability of structural data
  of allosteric proteins and modulators, as well as their complexes, have greatly
  contributed to the development of various computational approaches to guide the
  structure-based discovery of allosteric modulators. This perspective first outlines
  the evolution of the allosteric concept and describes the advantages and hurdles
  facing allosteric modulator discovery. The current available computational approaches,
  together with experimental approaches aiming to highlight allosteric studies, are
  then highlighted, emphasizing successful examples with their combined applications.
  We aimed to increase the awareness of th...
