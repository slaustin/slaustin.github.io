abstract: We propose a new approach for the umbrella sampling method in molecular
  dynamics simulations of complex systems. An accelerated sampling of the slow degrees
  of freedom is achieved by generating a single self-adaptive trajectory that tends
  to span uniformly the reaction coordinate using a time dependent bias potential
  derived from the preceding history of the system. To show the convergent behavior
  and the efficiency of the method, we present the free energy surface of alanine
  dipeptide in water as a function of the backbone dihedral angles.
