abstract: A computational technique is proposed which combines the string method with
  a sampling technique to determine minimum free energy paths. The technique only
  requires to compute the mean force and another conditional expectation locally along
  the string, and therefore can be applied even if the number of collective variables
  kept in the free energy calculation is large. This is in contrast with other free
  energy sampling techniques which aim at mapping the full free energy landscape and
  whose cost increases exponentially with the number of collective variables kept
  in the free energy. Provided that the number of collective variables is large enough,
  the new technique captures the mechanism of transition in that it allows to determine
  the committor function for the reaction and, in particular, the transition state
  region. The new technique is illustrated on the example of alanine dipeptide, in
  which we compute the minimum free energy path for the isomerization transition using
  either two or four dihedral angles as collective variables. It is shown that the
  mechanism of transition can be captured using the four dihedral angles, but it cannot
  be captured using only two of them.
