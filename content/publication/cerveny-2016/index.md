abstract: Studies of protein dynamics at low temperatures are generally performed
  on hydrated powders and not in biologically realistic solutions of water because
  of water crystallization. However, here we avoid the problem of crystallization
  by reducing the size of the biomolecules. We have studied oligomers of the amino
  acid l-lysine, fully dissolved in water, and our dielectric relaxation data show
  that the glass transition-related dynamics of the oligomers is determined by the
  water dynamics, in a way similar to that previously observed for solvated proteins.
  This implies that the crucial role of water for protein dynamics can be extended
  to other types of macromolecular systems, where water is also able to determine
  their conformational fluctuations. Using the energy landscape picture of macromolecules,
  the thermodynamic criterion for such solvent-slaved macromolecular motions may be
  that the macromolecules need the entropy contribution from the solvent to overcome
  the enthalpy barriers between different conformational substates.
