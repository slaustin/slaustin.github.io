abstract: Human topoisomerase I relaxes superhelical tension associated with DNA replication,
  transcription and recombination by reversibly nicking one strand of duplex DNA and
  forming a covalent 3$prime$-phosphotyrosine linkage. This enzyme is the sole target
  of the camptothecin family of anticancer compounds, which acts by stabilizing the
  covalent protein-DNA complex and enhancing apoptosis through blocking the advancement
  of replication forks. Mutations that impart resistance to camptothecin have been
  identified in several regions of human topoisomerase I. We present the crystal structures
  of two camptothecin-resistant forms of human topoisomerase I (Phe361Ser at 2.6Å
  resolution and Asn722Ser at 2.3Å resolution) in ternary complexes with DNA and topotecan
  (Hycamtin®), a camptothecin analogue currently in widespread clinical use. While
  the alteration of Asn722 to Ser leads to the elimination of a water-mediated contact
  between the enzyme and topotecan, we were surprised to find that a well-ordered
  water molecule replaces the hydrophobic phenylalanine side-chain in the Phe361Ser
  structure. We further consider camptothecin- resistant mutations at seven additional
  sites in human topoisomerase I and present structural evidence explaining their
  possible impact on drug binding. These results advance our understanding of the
  mechanism of cell poisoning by camptothecin and suggest specific modifications to
  the drug that may improve efficacy. o̧pyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
