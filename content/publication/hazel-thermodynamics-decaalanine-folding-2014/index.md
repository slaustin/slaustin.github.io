abstract: The determination of the folding dynamics of polypeptides and proteins is
  critical in characterizing their functions in biological systems. Numerous computational
  models and methods have been developed for studying structure formation at the atomic
  level. Due to its small size and simple structure, deca-alanine is used as a model
  system in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The free energy of unfolding in vacuum
  has been studied extensively using the end-to-end distance of the peptide as the
  reaction coordinate. However, few studies have been conducted in the presence of
  explicit solvent. Previous results show a significant decrease in the free energy
  of extended conformations in water, but the $α$-helical state is still notably favored
  over the extended state. Although sufficient in vacuum, we show that end-to-end
  distance is incapable of capturing the full complexity of deca-alanine folding in
  water. Using $α$-helical content as a second reaction coordinate, we deduce a more
  descriptive free-energy landscape, one which reveals a second energy minimum in
  the extended conformations that is of comparable free energy to the $α$-helical
  state. Equilibrium simulations demonstrate the relative stability of the extended
  and $α$-helical states in water as well as the transition between the two states.
  This work reveals both the necessity and challenge of determining a proper reaction
  coordinate to fully characterize a given process. o̧pyright 2014 American Chemical
