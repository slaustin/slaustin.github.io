abstract: 'Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water
  in the NPT ensemble at 25 $^∘$C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular
  potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal-Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P,
  and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data
  including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed
  densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except
  for the original BF model, which yields an 18% overestimate of the density and poor
  structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen-oxygen partial structure
  functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with
  the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed
  results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently,
  the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron
  data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also
  made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.
  Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic
  descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous
  solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive
  from a computational standpoint. o̧pyright 1983 American Institute of Physics.'
