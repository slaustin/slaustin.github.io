abstract: This article provides a brief, up-to-date review of the theory of activated
  relaxations in supercooled condensed systems, of Wolynes and coworkers. Supercooled
  liquids and frozen glasses are truly frustrated systems whose microscopic dynamics
  consist of cooperative motions, high in the energy spectrum of structural states,
  and well above the defect states of an ordered solid. There is a temperature below
  which activated processes dominate dynamics and thus a free energy landscape emerges,
  many of whose microscopic attributes can be computed. In addition to signature phenomena
  in supercooled liquids, we apply this microscopic picture to the phenomenon of slaving
  of large scale conformational changes of a folded protein, imbedded in a glass-forming
  solvent, to the solvent motions. The size of the basin encompassing the corresponding
  conformational substates will be deduced, based on kinetic measurements alone. Implications
  of the theory for interpreting computer simulations of glass-forming systems are
  discussed. oÌ§pyright 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
