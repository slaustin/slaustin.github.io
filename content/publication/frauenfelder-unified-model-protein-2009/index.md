abstract: Protein functions require conformational motions. We show here that the
  dominant conformational motions are slaved by the hydration shell and the bulk solvent.
  The protein contributes the structure necessary for function. We formulate a model
  that is based on experiments, insights from the physics of glass-forming liquids,
  and the concepts of a hierarchically organized energy landscape. To explore the
  effect of external fluctuations on protein dynamics, we measure the fluctuations
  in the bulk solvent and the hydration shell with broadband dielectric spectroscopy
  and compare them with internal fluctuations measured with the Mössbauer effect and
  neutron scattering. The result is clear. Large-scale protein motions are slaved
  to the fluctuations in the bulk solvent. They are controlled by the solvent viscosity,
  and are absent in a solid environment. Internal protein motions are slaved to the
  beta fluctuations of the hydration shell, are controlled by hydration, and are absent
  in a dehydrated protein. The model quantitatively predicts the rapid increase of
  the mean-square displacement above $≈$200 K, shows that the external beta fluctuations
  determine the temperature- and time-dependence of the passage of carbon monoxide
  through myoglobin, and explains the nonexponential time dependence of the protein
  relaxation after photodissociation.
