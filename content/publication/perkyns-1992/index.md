abstract: A liquid state theory based on site-site integral equations is constructed
  to have the asymptotics given by angular expansion theory. This results in a theory
  which shows dielectric consistency, e.g., the dielectric constant as viewed from
  the solvent is the same as that viewed by the ions. Such consistency is lacking
  in other extended reference interaction site model (XRISM)-based theories and leads
  to unrealistic structural predictions. The Kirkwood-Buff route to thermodynamics
  is used and allows a physical partitioning of the terms responsible for the solvation
  process. Sample results for a 1-1 salt are given.
