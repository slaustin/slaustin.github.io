abstract: Drug resistance of pathogens has necessitated the identification of novel
  targets for antibiotics. Thiamin (vitamin B1) is an essential cofactor for all organisms
  in its active form thiamin diphosphate (ThDP). Therefore, its metabolic pathways
  might be one largely untapped source of antibiotics targets. This review describes
  bacterial thiamin biosynthetic, salvage, and transport pathways. Essential thiamin
  synthetic enzymes such as Dxs and ThiE are proposed as promising drug targets. The
  regulation mechanism of thiamin biosynthesis by ThDP riboswitch is also discussed.
  As drug targets of existing antimicrobial compound pyrithiamin, the ThDP riboswitch
  might serves as alternative targets for more antibiotics.
