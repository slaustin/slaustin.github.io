abstract: To understand the role of water in life at molecular and atomic levels,
  structures and interactions at the protein-water interface have been investigated
  by cryogenic X-ray crystallography. The method enabled a much clearer visualization
  of definite hydration sites on the protein surface than at ambient temperature.
  Using the structural models of proteins, including several hydration water molecules,
  the characteristics in hydration structures were systematically analysed for the
  amount, the interaction geometries between water molecules and proteins, and the
  local and global distribution of water molecules on the surface of proteins. The
  tetrahedral hydrogen-bond geometry of water molecules in bulk solvent was retained
  at the interface and enabled the extension of a three-dimensional chain connection
  of a hydrogen-bond network among hydration water molecules and polar protein atoms
  over the entire surface of proteins. Networks of hydrogen bonds were quite flexible
  to accommodate and/or to regulate the conformational changes of proteins such as
  domain motions. The present experimental results may have profound implications
  in the understanding of the physico-chemical principles governing the dynamics of
  proteins in an aqueous environment and a discussion of why water is essential to
  life at a molecular level.
