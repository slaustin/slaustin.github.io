abstract: Ammonia transfer from the glutamine site to the fructose-6P site of bacterial
  glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase was studied by molecular dynamics simulations.
  The studies suggest a key role for Trp74, in the sealing of the hydrophobic channel
  connecting the two binding sites, as well as for the two Ala602 and Val605 residues,
  which form a narrow passage whose opening/closing constitutes an essential event
  in ammonia transfer. Kinetic analyses of the corresponding protein mutants confirmed
  our predictions. The efficiency of ammonia transfer which was close to zero in the
  W74A mutant was partially restored by increasing the size of the corresponding side-chain;
  the simulations performed on the W74A mutant suggested the formation of a hole in
  the channel. In the case of A602L and V605L mutants, the efficiency of ammonia transfer
  decreased to $∼$50% of the value of the native protein. None of the mutants were,
  however, able to use exogenous ammonia as a substrate. o̧pyright 2007 Federation
