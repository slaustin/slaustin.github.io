abstract: A new implementation of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) method is described.
  This implementation supports a wide range of collective variables and can be applied
  to the computation of multidimensional energy profiles. It is provided to the community
  as part of a code that implements several analogous methods, including metadynamics.
  ABF and metadynamics have not previously been tested side by side on identical systems.
  Here, numerical tests are carried out on processes including conformational changes
  in model peptides and translocation of a halide ion across a lipid membrane through
  a peptide nanotube. On the basis of these examples, we discuss similarities and
  differences between the ABF and metadynamics schemes. Both approaches provide enhanced
  sampling and free energy profiles in quantitative agreement with each other in different
  applications. The method of choice depends on the dimension of the reaction coordinate
  space, the height of the barriers, and the relaxation times of degrees of freedom
  in the orthogonal space, which are not explicitly described by the chosen collective
  variables.
