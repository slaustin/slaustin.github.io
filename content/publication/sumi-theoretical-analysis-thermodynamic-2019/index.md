abstract: Understanding the dominant factor in thermodynamic stability of proteins
  remains an open challenge. Kauzmann's hydrophobic interaction hypothesis, which
  considers hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar groups as the dominant factor,
  has been widely accepted for about sixty years and attracted many scientists. The
  hypothesis, however, has not been verified or disproved because it is difficult,
  both theoretically and experimentally, to quantify the solvent effects on the free
  energy change in protein folding. Here, we developed a computational method for
  extracting the dominant factor behind thermodynamic stability of proteins and applied
  it to a small, designed protein, chignolin. The resulting free energy profile quantitatively
  agreed with the molecular dynamics simulations. Decomposition of the free energy
  profile indicated that intramolecular interactions predominantly stabilized collapsed
  conformations, whereas solvent-induced interactions, including hydrophobic ones,
  destabilized them. These results obtained for chignolin were consistent with the
  site-directed mutagenesis and calorimetry experiments for globular proteins with
  hydrophobic interior cores.
