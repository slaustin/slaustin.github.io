 abstract = {The atomic co-ordinates from 16 high-resolution ($łeq$1.7 Å; 1 Å = 0.1 nm), non-homologous proteins have been used to study the distributions of water molecule sites around the 20 different amino acid residues. The proportion of residues whose main-chain atoms are in contact with water molecules was fairly constant (between 40% and 60%), irrespective of the nature of the side-chain. However, the proportion of residues whose side-chain atoms were in contact with water molecules showed a clear (inverse) correlation with the hydrophobicity of the residue, being as low as 14% for leucine and isoleucine but greater than 80% for asparagine and arginine. Despite the problems in determining accurate water molecule sites from X-ray diffraction data and the complexity of the protein surface, distinct non-random distributions of water molecules were found. These hydration patterns are consistent with the expected stereochemistry of the potential hydrogen-bonding sites on the polar side-chains. The water molecules around apolar side-chains lie predominantly at van der Waals' contact distances, but most of these have a primary, shorter contact with a neighbouring polar atom. Further analysis of these distributions, combined with energy minimization techniques, should lead to improved modelling of protein structures, including their primary shells of hydration. o̧pyright 1988.},
