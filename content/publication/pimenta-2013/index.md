abstract: The TEM family of enzymes has had a crucial impact on the pharmaceutical
  industry due to their important role in antibiotic resistance. Even with the latest
  technologies in structural biology and genomics, no 3D structure of a TEM-1/antibiotic
  complex is known previous to acylation. Therefore, the comprehension of their capability
  in acylate antibiotics is based on the protein macromolecular structure uncomplexed.
  In this work, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations, and relative free
  energy calculations were applied in order to get a comprehensive and thorough analysis
  of TEM-1/ampicillin and TEM-1/amoxicillin complexes. We described the complexes
  and analyzed the effect of ligand binding on the overall structure. We clearly demonstrate
  that the key residues involved in the stability of the ligand (hot-spots) vary with
  the nature of the ligand. Structural effects such as (i) the distances between interfacial
  residues (Ser70-O$γ$ and Lys73-N$ζ$, Lys73-N$ζ$ and Ser130-O$γ$, and Ser70-O$γ$-Ser130-O$γ$),
  (ii) side chain rotamer variation (Tyr105 and Glu240), and (iii) the presence of
  conserved waters can be also influenced by ligand binding. This study supports the
  hypothesis that TEM-1 suffers structural modifications upon ligand binding.
