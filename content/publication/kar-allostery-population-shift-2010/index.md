abstract: 'Proteins can exist in a large number of conformations around their native
  states that can be characterized by an energy landscape. The landscape illustrates
  individual valleys, which are the conformational substates. From the functional
  standpoint, there are two key points: first, all functionally relevant substates
  pre-exist; and second, the landscape is dynamic and the relative populations of
  the substates will change following allosteric events. Allosteric events perturb
  the structure, and the energetic strain propagates and shifts the population. This
  can lead to changes in the shapes and properties of target binding sites. Here we
  present an overview of dynamic conformational ensembles focusing on allosteric events
  in signaling. We propose that combining equilibrium fluctuation concepts with genomic
  screens could help drug discovery.'
