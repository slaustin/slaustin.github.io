abstract: $β$-Lactamases are widespread in the bacterial world, where they are responsible
  for resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and related compounds, currently
  the most widely used antibacterial agents. Detailed structural and mechanistic understanding
  of these enzymes can be expected to guide the design of new antibacterial compounds
  resistant to their action. A number of high-resolution structures are available
  for class A $β$-lactamases, whose catalytic mechanism involves the acylation of
  a serine residue at the active site. The identity of the general base which participates
  in the activation of this serine residue during catalysis has been the subject of
  controversy, both a lysine residue and a glutamic acid residue having been proposed
  as candidates for this role. We have used the pH dependence of chemical modification
  of $ɛ$-amino groups by 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzenesulfonate and the pH dependence of
  the $ɛ$-methylene 1H and 13C chemical shifts (in enzyme selectively labeled with
  [$ɛ$-13C]lysine) to estimate the pK(a) of the relevant lysine residue, lysine-73,
  of TEM-1 $β$-lactamase. Both methods show that the pK(a) of this residue is $>$
  10, making it very unlikely that this residue could act as a proton acceptor in
  catalysis. An alternative mechanism in which this role is performed by glutamate-166
  through an intervening water molecule is described.
