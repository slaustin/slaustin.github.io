abstract: The conformational preference for different $ϕ$/$Ψ$ backbone torsion angles
  is a key determinant of peptide and protein secondary structure. Often, dipeptides
  are used as models for understanding protein backbone dynamics and to derive force
  field parameters. Here, the question is examined to what extent the conformational
  preferences in dipeptides reflect the backbone dynamics in polypeptides and proteins
  and to what extent an alanine dipeptide-based backbone torsion parametrization can
  lead to accurate reproduction of amino acid dependent $ϕ$/$Ψ$ preferences in protein
  structures. Results from a comparison of the analysis of Protein Data Bank (PDB)
  structures with long simulations of selected proteins and amino acid dipeptides
  suggest that a common alanine dipeptide-based torsion potential does in fact lead
  to excellent agreement between protein simulations and PDB structures. At the same
  time, the $ϕ$/$Ψ$ preferences in the dipeptides are significantly different, suggesting
  that dipeptides are not good model systems for studying protein backbone dynamics.
