abstract: ConspectusThe observation of complex structural transitions in biological
  and abiological molecular objects within time scales amenable to molecular dynamics
  (MD) simulations is often hampered by significant free energy barriers associated
  with entangled movements. Importance-sampling algorithms, a powerful class of numerical
  schemes for the investigation of rare events, have been widely used to extend simulations
  beyond the time scale common to MD. However, probing processes spanning milliseconds
  through microsecond molecular simulations still constitutes in practice a daunting
  challenge because of the difficulty of taming the ruggedness of multidimensional
  free energy surfaces by means of naive transition coordinates. To address this limitation,
  in recent years we have elaborated importance-sampling methods relying on an adaptive
  biasing force (ABF). In this Account, we review recent developments of algorithms
  aimed at mapping rugged free energy landscapes that correspond to complex processes
  of physical, chemical, and biological relevance. Through these developments, we
  have broadened the spectrum of applications of the popular ABF algorithm while improving
  its computational efficiency, notably for multidimensional free energy calculations.
  One major algorithmic advance, coined meta-eABF, merges the key features of metadynamics
  and an extended Lagrangian variant of ABF (eABF) by simultaneously shaving the barriers
  and flooding the valleys of the free energy landscape, and it possesses a convergence
  rate up to 5-fold greater than those of other importance-sampling algorithms. Through
  faster convergence and enhanced ergodic properties, meta-eABF represents a significant
  step forward in the simulation of millisecond-time-scale events. Here we introduce
  extensions of the algorithm, notably its well-tempered and replica-exchange variants,
  which further boost the sampling efficiency while gaining in numerical stability,
  thus allowing quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical free energy calculations to
  be performed at a lower cost. As a paradigm to bridge microsecond simulations to
  millisecond events by means of free energy calculations, we have applied the ABF
  family of algorithms to decompose complex movements in molecular objects of biological
  and abiological nature. We show here how water lubricates the shuttling of an amide-based
  rotaxane by altering the mechanism that underlies the concerted translation and
  isomerization of the macrocycle. Introducing novel collective variables in a computational
  workflow for the rigorous determination of standard binding free energies, we predict
  with utmost accuracy the thermodynamics of protein-ligand reversible association.
  Because of their simplicity, versatility, and robust mathematical foundations, the
  algorithms of the ABF family represent an appealing option for the theoretical investigation
  of a broad range of problems relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.
