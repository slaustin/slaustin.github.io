abstract: Human serum paraoxonase 1 (HuPON1) is an enzyme that can hydrolyze various
  chemical warfare nerve agents including VX. A previous study has suggested that
  increasing HuPON1's VX hydrolysis activity one to two orders of magnitude would
  make the enzyme an effective countermeasure for in vivo use against VX. This study
  helps facilitate further engineering of HuPON1 for enhanced VX-hydrolase activity
  by computationally characterizing HuPON1's tertiary structure and how HuPON1 binds
  VX. HuPON1's structure is first predicted through two homology modeling procedures.
  Docking is then performed using four separate methods, and the stability of each
  bound conformation is analyzed through molecular dynamics and solvated interaction
  energy calculations. The results show that VX's lone oxygen atom has a strong preference
  for forming a direct electrostatic interaction with HuPON1's active site calcium
  ion. Various HuPON1 residues are also detected that are in close proximity to VX
  and are therefore potential targets for future mutagenesis studies. These include
  E53, H115, N168, F222, N224, L240, D269, I291, F292, and V346. Additionally, D183
  was found to have a predicted pKa near physiological pH. Given D183's location in
  HuPON1's active site, this residue could potentially act as a proton donor or accepter
  during hydrolysis. The results from the binding simulations also indicate that steered
  molecular dynamics can potentially be used to obtain accurate binding predictions
  even when starting with a closed conformation of a protein's binding or active site.
