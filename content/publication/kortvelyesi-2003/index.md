abstract: 'Computational mapping methods place molecular probes (small molecules or
  functional groups) on a protein surface to identify the most favorable binding positions
  by calculating an interaction potential. We have developed a novel computational
  mapping program called CS-Map (computational solvent mapping of proteins), which
  differs from earlier mapping methods in three respects: (i) it initially moves the
  ligands on the protein surface toward regions with favorable electrostatics and
  desolvation, (ii) the final scoring potential accounts for desolvation, and (iii)
  the docked ligand positions are clustered, and the clusters are ranked on the basis
  of their average free energies. To understand the relative importance of these factors,
  we developed alternative algorithms that use the DOCK and GRAMM programs for the
  initial search. Because of the availability of experimental solvent mapping data,
  lysozyme and thermolysin are considered as test proteins. Both DOCK and GRAMM speed
  up the initial search, and the combined algorithms yield acceptable mapping results.
  However, the DOCK-based approaches place the consensus site farther from its experimentally
  determined position than CS-Map, primarily because of the lack of a solvation term
  in the initial search. The GRAMM-based program also finds the correct consensus
  site for thermolysin. We conclude that good sampling is the most important requirement
  for successful mapping, but accounting for desolvation and clustering of ligand
  positions also help to reduce the number of false positives. oÌ§pyright 2003 Wiley-Liss,
