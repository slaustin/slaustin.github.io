abstract: In recent years, atomistic molecular simulations have become a method of
  choice for studying the interaction of small molecules, peptides, and proteins with
  biological membranes. Here, we critically examine the statistical convergence of
  equilibrium properties in molecular simulations of two amino acid side-chain analogs,
  leucine and arginine, in the presence of a hydrated phospholipid bilayer. To this
  end, the convergence of the standard binding free energy for the reversible insertion
  of the solutes in the bilayer is systematically assessed by evaluating dozens of
  separate sets of umbrella sampling calculations for a total simulation time exceeding
  400 $μ$s. We identify rare and abrupt transitions in bilayer structure as a function
  of solute insertion depth. These transitions correspond to the slow reorganization
  of ionic interactions involving zwitterionic phospholipid headgroups when the solutes
  penetrate the lipid-water interface and when arginine is forced through the bilayer
  center. These rare events are shown to constitute hidden sampling barriers that
  limit the rate of convergence of equilibrium properties and result in systematic
  sampling errors. Our analysis demonstrates that the difficulty of attaining convergence
  for lipid bilayer-embedded solutes has, in general, been drastically underestimated.
  This information will assist future studies in improving accuracy by selecting a
  more appropriate reaction coordinate or by focusing computational resources on those
  regions of the reaction coordinate that exhibit slow convergence of equilibrium
  properties. o̧pyright 2011 American Chemical Society.
