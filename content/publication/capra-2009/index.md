abstract: Identifying a protein's functional sites is an important step towards characterizing
  its molecular function. Numerous structure- and sequence-based methods have been
  developed for this problem. Here we introduce ConCavity, a small molecule binding
  site prediction algorithm that integrates evolutionary sequence conservation estimates
  with structurebased methods for identifying protein surface cavities. In large-scale
  testing on a diverse set of single- and multi-chain protein structures, we show
  that ConCavity substantially outperforms existing methods for identifying both 3D
  ligand binding pockets and individual ligand binding residues. As part of our testing,
  we perform one of the first direct comparisons of conservation-based and structure-based
  methods. We find that the two approaches provide largely complementary information,
  which can be combined to improve upon either approach alone. We also demonstrate
  that ConCavity has state-of-the-art performance in predicting catalytic sites and
  drug binding pockets. Overall, the algorithms and analysis presented here significantly
  improve our ability to identify ligand binding sites and further advance our understanding
  of the relationship between evolutionary sequence conservation and structural and
  functional attributes of proteins. Data, source code, and prediction visualizations
  are available on the ConCavity web site (http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/concavity/).
