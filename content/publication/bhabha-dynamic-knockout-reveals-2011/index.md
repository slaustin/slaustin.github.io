abstract: An               Escherichia coli               dihydrofolate reductase
  mutant is catalytically defective, because motions in the active site are impaired.                        ,                             Conformational
  dynamics play a key role in enzyme catalysis. Although protein motions have clear
  implications for ligand flux, a role for dynamics in the chemical step of enzyme
  catalysis has not been clearly established. We generated a mutant of               Escherichia
  coli               dihydrofolate reductase that abrogates millisecond-time-scale
  fluctuations in the enzyme active site without perturbing its structural and electrostatic
  preorganization. This dynamic knockout severely impairs hydride transfer. Thus,
  we have found a link between conformational fluctuations on the millisecond time
  scale and the chemical step of an enzymatic reaction, with broad implications for
  our understanding of enzyme mechanisms and for design of novel protein catalysts.
