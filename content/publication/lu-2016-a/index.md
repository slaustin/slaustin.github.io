abstract: The binding of a ligand to a protein may induce long-range structural or
  dynamical changes in the biomacromolecule even at sites physically well separated
  from the binding pocket. A system for which such behavior has been widely discussed
  is the PDZ2 domain of human tyrosine phosphatase 1E. Here, we present results from
  equilibrium trajectories of the PDZ2 domain in the free and ligand-bound state,
  as well as nonequilibrium simulations of the relaxation of PDZ2 after removal of
  its peptide ligand. The study reveals changes in inter-residue contacts, backbone
  dihedral angles, and C$α$ positions upon ligand release. Our findings show a long-range
  conformational response of the PDZ2 domain to ligand release in the form of a collective
  shift of the secondary structure elements $α$2, $β$2, $β$3, $α$1- $β$4, and the
  C terminal loop relative to the rest of the protein away from the N-terminus, and
  a shift of the loops $β$2-$β$3 and $β$1-$β$2 in the opposite direction. The shifts
  lead to conformational changes in the backbone, especially in the $β$2-$β$3 loop
  but also in the $β$5-$α$2 and the $α$2-$β$6 loop, and are accompanied by changes
  of inter-residue contacts mainly within the $β$2-$β$3 loop as well as between the
  $α$2 helix and other segments. The residues showing substantial changes of inter-residue
  contacts, backbone conformations, or C$α$ positions are considered ``key residues''
  for the long-range conformational response of PDZ2. By comparing these residues
  with various sets of residues highlighted by previous studies of PDZ2, we investigate
  the statistical correlation of the various approaches. Interestingly, we find a
  considerable correlation of our findings with several works considering structural
  changes but no significant correlations with approaches considering energy flow
  or networks based on inter-residue energies.
