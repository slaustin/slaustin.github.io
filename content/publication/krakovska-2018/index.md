abstract: 'In this comparative study, six causality detection methods were compared,
  namely, the Granger vector autoregressive test, the extended Granger test, the kernel
  version of the Granger test, the conditional mutual information (transfer entropy),
  the evaluation of cross mappings between state spaces, and an assessment of predictability
  improvement due to the use of mixed predictions. Seven test data sets were analyzed:
  linear coupling of autoregressive models, a unidirectional connection of two Hénon
  systems, a unidirectional connection of chaotic systems of Rössler and Lorenz type
  and of two different Rössler systems, an example of bidirectionally connected two-species
  systems, a fishery model as an example of two correlated observables without a causal
  relationship, and an example of mediated causality. We tested not only 20000 points
  long clean time series but also noisy and short variants of the data. The standard
  and the extended Granger tests worked only for the autoregressive models. The remaining
  methods were more successful with the more complex test examples, although they
  differed considerably in their capability to reveal the presence and the direction
  of coupling and to distinguish causality from mere correlation.'
