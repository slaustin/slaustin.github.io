abstract: We derive, implement, and apply equilibrium solvation site analysis for
  biomolecules. Our method utilizes 3D-RISM calculations to quickly obtain equilibrium
  solvent distributions without either necessity of simulation or limits of solvent
  sampling. Our analysis of these distributions extracts highest likelihood poses
  of solvent as well as localized entropies, enthalpies, and solvation free energies.
  We demonstrate our method on a structure of HIV-1 protease where excellent structural
  and thermodynamic data are available for comparison. Our results, obtained within
  minutes, show systematic agreement with available experimental data. Further, our
  results are in good agreement with established simulation-based solvent analysis
  methods. This method can be used not only for visual analysis of active site solvation
  but also for virtual screening methods and experimental refinement.
