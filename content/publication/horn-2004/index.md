abstract: Although inhibitors typically bind pre-formed sites on proteins, it is theoretically
  possible to inhibit by disrupting the folded structure of a protein or, in the limit,
  to bind preferentially to the unfolded state. Equilibria defining how such molecules
  act are well understood, but structural models for such binding are unknown. Two
  novel inhibitors of $β$-lactamase were found to destabilize the enzyme at high temperatures,
  but at lower temperatures showed no preference for destabilized mutant enzymes versus
  stabilized mutants. X-ray crystal structures showed that both inhibitors bound to
  a cryptic site in $β$-lactamase, which the inhibitors themselves created by forcing
  apart helixes 11 and 12. This opened up a portion of the hydrophobic core of the
  protein, into which these two inhibitors bind. Although this binding site is 16
  Å from the center of the active site, the conformational changes were transmitted
  through a sequence of linked motions to a key catalytic residue, Arg244, which in
  the complex adopts conformations very different from those in catalytically competent
  enzyme conformations. These structures offer a detailed view of what has heretofore
  been a theoretical construct, and suggest the possibility for further design against
  this novel site. o̧pyright 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
