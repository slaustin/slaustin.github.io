abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of studies exploring
  the relationship between proteins' equilibrium dynamics and structural changes involved
  in function. An emerging concept, supported by both theory and experiments, is that
  under native state conditions proteins have an intrinsic ability to sample conformations
  that meet functional requirements. A typical example is the ability of enzymes to
  sample open and closed forms, irrespective of substrate, succeeded by the stabilization
  of one form (usually closed) upon substrate binding. This ability is structure-encoded,
  and plays a key role in facilitating allosteric regulation, which suggests complementing
  the sequence-encodes-structure paradigm of protein science by structure-encodes-dynamics-encodes-function.
  The emerging connection implies an evolutionary role in selecting/conserving structures
  based on their ability to achieve functional dynamics, and in turn, selecting sequences
  that fold into such 'apt' structures. oÌ§pyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
