abstract: The synergy between structure and dynamics is essential to the function
  of biological macromolecules. Thermally driven dynamics on different timescales
  have been experimentally observed or simulated, and a direct link between micro-
  to milli-second domain motions and enzymatic function has been established. However,
  very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective
  movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that
  pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate
  kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically
  competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic
  adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic
  activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different
  timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their
  linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein
  energy landscapes.
