abstract: The main focus of enzymology is on the enzyme rates, substrate structures,
  and reactivity, whereas the role of solvent dynamics in mediating the biological
  reaction is often left aside owing to its complex molecular behavior. We used integrated
  X-ray- and terahertz-based time-resolved spectroscopic tools to study protein-water
  dynamics during proteolysis of collagen-like substrates by a matrix metalloproteinase.
  We show equilibration of structural kinetic transitions in the millisecond timescale
  during degradation of the two model substrates collagen and gelatin, which have
  different supersecondary structure and flexibility. Unexpectedly, the detected changes
  in collective enzyme-substrate-water-coupled motions persisted well beyond steady
  state for both substrates while displaying substrate-specific behaviors. Molecular
  dynamics simulations further showed that a hydration funnel (i.e., a gradient in
  retardation of hydrogen bond (HB) dynamics toward the active site) is substrate-dependent,
  exhibiting a steeper gradient for the more complex enzyme-collagen system. The long-lasting
  changes in protein-water dynamics reflect a collection of local energetic equilibrium
  states specifically formed during substrate conversion. Thus, the observed long-lasting
  water dynamics contribute to the net enzyme reactivity, impacting substrate binding,
  positional catalysis, and product release.
