abstract: FTMap is a computational mapping server that identifies binding hot spots
  of macromolecules-i.e., regions of the surface with major contributions to the ligand-binding
  free energy. To use FTMap, users submit a protein, DNA or RNA structure in PDB (Protein
  Data Bank) format. FTMap samples billions of positions of small organic molecules
  used as probes, and it scores the probe poses using a detailed energy expression.
  Regions that bind clusters of multiple probe types identify the binding hot spots
  in good agreement with experimental data. FTMap serves as the basis for other servers,
  namely FTSite, which is used to predict ligand-binding sites, FTFlex, which is used
  to account for side chain flexibility, FTMap/param, used to parameterize additional
  probes and FTDyn, for mapping ensembles of protein structures. Applications include
  determining the druggability of proteins, identifying ligand moieties that are most
  important for binding, finding the most bound-like conformation in ensembles of
  unliganded protein structures and providing input for fragment-based drug design.
  FTMap is more accurate than classical mapping methods such as GRID and MCSS, and
  it is much faster than the more-recent approaches to protein mapping based on mixed
  molecular dynamics. By using 16 probe molecules, the FTMap server finds the hot
  spots of an average-size protein in $<$1 h. As FTFlex performs mapping for all low-energy
  conformers of side chains in the binding site, its completion time is proportionately
  longer.
