abstract: A new integral equation theory is proposed, which enables us to efficiently
  compute conformational distribution of a polyatomic molecule in solution phase.
  The solvation effect on the intramolecular correlation function is evaluated through
  a self-consistent procedure. In addition, the analytical expression of solvation
  free energy is derived, explicitly taking into account the molecular structural
  fluctuation. The derived equation establishes a direct route between the structural
  fluctuation and free energy of the molecule. The method was successfully applied
  to a series of n-alkanes in aqueous solutions to demonstrate the superiority of
  the proposed theory.
