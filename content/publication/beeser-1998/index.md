abstract: 15Nitrogen relaxation experiments were used to characterize the backbone
  dynamics of two modified forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). In
  one form, the disulfide between Cys14 and Cys38 in the wild-type protein was selectively
  reduced and methylated to generate an analog of the final intermediate in the disulfide-coupled
  folding pathway. The second form was generated by similarly modifying a mutant protein
  in which Tyr35 was replaced with Gly (Y35G). For both selectively reduced proteins,
  the overall conformation of native BPTI was retained, and the relaxation data for
  these proteins were compared with those obtained previously with the native wild-type
  and Y35G proteins. Removing the disulfide from either protein had only small effects
  on the observed longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) or heteronuclear cross relaxation
  rates (nuclear Overhauser effect), suggesting that the 14-38 disulfide has little
  influence on the fast (ps to ns) backbone dynamics of either protein. In the wild-type
  protein, the pattern of residues undergoing slower ($Î¼$s to ms) internal motions,
  reflected in unusually large transverse relaxation rates (R2), was also largely
  unaffected by the removal of this disulfide. It thus appears that the large R2rates
  previously observed in native wild-type protein are not a direct consequence of
  isomerization of the 14-38 disulfide. In contrast with the wild-type protein, reducing
  the disulfide in Y35G BPTI significantly decreased the number of backbone amides
  displaying large R2rates. In addition, the frequencies of the backbone motions in
  the modified protein, estimated from R2values measured at multiple refocusing delays,
  appear to span a wider range than those seen in native Y35G BPTI. Together, these
  observations suggest that the slow internal motions in Y35G BPTI are more independent
  in the absence of the 14-38 disulfide and that formation of this bond may lead to
  a substantial loss of conformational entropy. These effects may account for the
  previous observation that the Y35G substitution greatly destabilizes the disulfide.
  The results also demonstrate that the disulfide and the buried side-chain influence
  the dynamics of the folded protein in a highly cooperative fashion, with the effects
  of removing either being much greater in the absence of the other.
