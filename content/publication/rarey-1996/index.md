abstract: We present an automatic method for docking organic ligands into protein
  binding sites. The method can be used in the design process of specific protein
  ligands. It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical properties of
  the docked molecules with efficient methods for sampling the conformational space
  of the ligand. If the ligand is flexible, it can adopt a large variety of different
  conformations. Each such minimum in conformational space presents a potential candidate
  for the conformation of the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking method samples
  the conformation space of the ligand on the basis of a discrete model and uses a
  tree-search technique for placing the ligand incrementally into the active site.
  For placing the first fragment of the ligand into the protein, we use hashing techniques
  adapted from computer vision. The incremental construction algorithm is based on
  a greedy strategy combined with efficient methods for overlap detection and for
  the search of new interactions. We present results on 19 complexes of which the
  binding geometry has been crystallographically determined. All considered ligands
  are docked in at most three minutes on a current workstation. The experimentally
  observed binding mode of the ligand is reproduced with 0.5 to 1.2 Ã… rms deviation.
  It is almost always found among the highest-ranking conformations computed.
