abstract: An analysis is made of the time dependence of the atomic motions obtained
  from two molecular dynamics simulations of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor;
  one simulation is for the protein in vacuum and the other for the protein in a van
  der Waals solvent with the atom size and density corresponding to those of water.
  Time series, correlation functions, and the time development of the mean square
  fluctuations are examined. A wide range of relaxation times is found for the displacement
  correlation functions (0.2-10 ps); the values of the relaxation times correlate
  with aspects of the structure and with the magnitude of the mean square displacements,
  as expected from the Langevin equation for an oscillator. It is shown that the atomic
  fluctuations which contribute to the temperature factor (thermal ellipsoid) can
  be separated into local oscillations superposed on motions with a more collective
  character. The former have a subpicosecond time scale; the latter, which can involve
  only a few neighboring atoms, a residue, or groups of many atoms in a given region
  of the protein, have time scales ranging from 1 to 10 ps or longer (t = 3-30 cm-I).
  By following the time development of the atomic fluctuations from 0.2 to 25 ps,
  it is shown that the high-frequency oscillations, which contribute about 40% of
  the average root mean square fluctuations of main chain atoms, tend to be uniform
  over the structure. It is the longer time scale, more collective motions which introduce
  the variations in the fluctuation magnitudes that characterize different parts of
  the protein structure. These distributed modes are likely to be most sensitive to
  the external medium and to other environmental perturbations. Implications of these
  results for the function of proteins and analysis of anisotropic temperature factors
  are discussed.
