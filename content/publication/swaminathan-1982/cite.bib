 abstract = {An analysis is made of the time dependence of the atomic motions obtained from two molecular dynamics simulations of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; one simulation is for the protein in vacuum and the other for the protein in a van der Waals solvent with the atom size and density corresponding to those of water. Time series, correlation functions, and the time development of the mean square fluctuations are examined. A wide range of relaxation times is found for the displacement correlation functions (0.2-10 ps); the values of the relaxation times correlate with aspects of the structure and with the magnitude of the mean square displacements, as expected from the Langevin equation for an oscillator. It is shown that the atomic fluctuations which contribute to the temperature factor (thermal ellipsoid) can be separated into local oscillations superposed on motions with a more collective character. The former have a subpicosecond time scale; the latter, which can involve only a few neighboring atoms, a residue, or groups of many atoms in a given region of the protein, have time scales ranging from 1 to 10 ps or longer (t = 3-30 cm-I). By following the time development of the atomic fluctuations from 0.2 to 25 ps, it is shown that the high-frequency oscillations, which contribute about 40% of the average root mean square fluctuations of main chain atoms, tend to be uniform over the structure. It is the longer time scale, more collective motions which introduce the variations in the fluctuation magnitudes that characterize different parts of the protein structure. These distributed modes are likely to be most sensitive to the external medium and to other environmental perturbations. Implications of these results for the function of proteins and analysis of anisotropic temperature factors are discussed.},
