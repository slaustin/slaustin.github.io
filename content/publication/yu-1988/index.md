abstract: The free energy, energy, and entropy of solvation, relative to the pure
  liquid, are analyzed. Bya coupling parameter integration it is shown that only averages
  over the solute-solvent interaction energy contribute to the free energy and that
  the solvent-solvent interaction term, which contributes the so-called cavity (solvent
  reorganization) term to the energy, is cancelled exactly by a corresponding term
  in the entropy. These terms exist even in the infinite dilution limit since they
  arise from the derivative of the free energy with respect to the solute density.
  Following the approach of Garisto et 01. [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 6294 (1983)], the site-site
  Ornstein-Zernike integral equations and HNC closures are used to determine the derivatives
  of the distribution functions with respect to the density. This makes it possible
  to calculate the energetic and entropic contributions to the solvation free energy
  in the infinite dilution limit. The method is applied to pure solvent and to infinitely
  dilute aqueous solutions of cations, anions and neutral Lennard-Jones particles.
  The results are in agreement with numerical calculations of the thermodynamic quantities
  by use of finite difference values for the temperature derivatives. A simple empirical
  relation for the charge dependence of the solvation free energy is observed; it
  is shown for the case of an ion in a dipolar solvent, as typified by aqueous electrolyte
  solutions, that the free energy of solvation varies quadratically with the charge
  and is very nearly equal to one-halfthe solute-solvent portion of the solvation
  energy. Some discussion of the relation of the present results to entropy-enthalpy
  compensation and to computer simulations is given.
