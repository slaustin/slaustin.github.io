abstract: Allosteric regulation of proteins by conformational change is a primary
  means of biological control. Traditionally it has been difficult to identify and
  characterize novel allosteric sites and ligands that freeze these conformational
  states. We present a site-directed approach using Tethering for trapping inhibitory
  small molecules at sites away from the active site by reversible disulfide bond
  formation. We screened a library of 10,000 thiol-containing compounds against accessible
  cysteines of two members of the caspase family of proteases, caspase-3 and -7. We
  discovered a previously unreported and conserved allosteric site in a deep cavity
  at the dimer interface 14 A from the active site. This site contains a natural cysteine
  that, when disulfide-bonded with either of two specific compounds, inactivates these
  proteases. The allosteric site is functionally coupled to the active site, such
  that binding of the compounds at the allosteric site prevents peptide binding at
  the active site. The x-ray crystal structures of caspase-7 bound by either compound
  demonstrates that they inhibit caspase-7 by trapping a zymogen-like conformation.
  This approach may be useful to identify new allosteric sites from natural or engineered
  cysteines, to study allosteric transitions in proteins, and to nucleate drug discovery
  efforts.
