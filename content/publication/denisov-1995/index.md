abstract: Water oxygen-17 spin relaxation was used to study hydration and dynamics
  of the globular proteins bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and ubiquitin
  in aqueous solution. The frequency dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse
  relaxation rates was measured over the Larmor frequency range 2.6 to 49 MHz in the
  pD range 2 to 11 at 27 degrees C. While the protein-induced relaxation enhancement
  was similar for the two proteins at high frequencies, it was an order of magnitude
  smaller for ubiquitin than for BPTI at low frequencies. This difference was ascribed
  to the absence, in ubiquitin, of highly ordered internal water molecules, which
  are known to be present in BPTI and in most other globular proteins. These observations
  demonstrate that the water relaxation dispersion in protein solutions is essentially
  due to a few structural water molecules buried within the protein matrix, but exchanging
  rapidly with the external water. The relaxation data indicate that the internal
  water molecules of BPTI exchange with bulk water on the time-scale 10(-8) to 10(-6)
  second thus lowering the recently reported upper bound on the residence time of
  these internal water molecules by four orders of magnitude, and implying that local
  unfolding occurs on the submicrosecond time-scale. The water molecules residing
  at the surface of the two proteins were found to be highly mobile, with an average
  rotational correlation time of approximately 20 picoseconds. For both proteins,
  the oxygen-17 relaxation depended only very weakly on pD, showing that ionic residues
  do not perturb hydration water dynamics more than other surface residues. We believe
  that the present results resolve the long-standing controversy regarding the mechanism
  behind the spin relaxation dispersion of water nuclei in protein solutions, thus
  establishing oxygen-17 relaxation as a powerful tool for studies of structurally
  and functionally important water molecules in proteins and other biomolecules.
