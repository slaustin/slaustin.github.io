abstract: While the crucial role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in the
  cell cycle is now recognized, deciphering their molecular mode of action at the
  structural level still remains highly challenging and requires a combination of
  many biophysical approaches. Among them, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has
  been extremely successful in the last decade and has become an indispensable technique
  for addressing many of the fundamental questions regarding the activities of IDPs.
  After introducing some experimental issues specific to IDPs and in relation to the
  latest technical developments, this article presents the interest of the theory
  of polymer physics to evaluate the flexibility of fully disordered proteins. The
  different strategies to obtain 3-dimensional models of IDPs, free in solution and
  associated in a complex, are then reviewed. Indeed, recent computational advances
  have made it possible to readily extract maximum information from the scattering
  curve with a special emphasis on highly flexible systems, such as multidomain proteins
  and IDPs. Furthermore, integrated computational approaches now enable the generation
  of ensembles of conformers to translate the unique flexible characteristics of IDPs
  by taking into consideration the constraints of more and more various complementary
  experiment. In particular, a combination of SAXS with high-resolution techniques,
  such as x-ray crystallography and NMR, allows us to provide reliable models and
  to gain unique structural insights about the protein over multiple structural scales.
  The latest neutron scattering experiments also promise new advances in the study
  of the conformational changes of macromolecules involving more complex systems.
