abstract: Based on the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of phospholipase
  C from Bacillus cereus, the orientation of the phosphatidylcholine substrate in
  the active site of the enzyme is proposed. The proposal is based on extensive calculations
  using the GRID program and molecular mechanics geometry relaxations. The substrate
  model has been constructed by successively placing phosphate, choline and diacylglycerol
  moieties in the positions indicated from GRID calculations. On the basis of the
  resulting orientation of a complete phosphatidylcholine molecule, we propose a mechanism
  for the hydrolysis of the substrate. Copyright o̧pyright 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
