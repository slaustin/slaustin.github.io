 abstract = {A multidimensional extension of the original replica-exchange method is presented. One example of this approach is the combination of the replica-exchange method with the umbrella sampling, which the authors refer to as the replica-exchange umbrella sampling (REUS). While pairs of replicas with different temperatures are exchanged during the simulation in the original replica-exchange method, pairs of replicas with different temperatures and/or different biasing potential for the umbrella sampling are exchanged in REUS. This greatly enhances the sampling of the conformational space and allows accurate calculations of free energy in a wide temperature range from a single simulation run, using the weighted histogram analysis method. The difference between REUS and the conventional umbrella sampling is just whether the replica-exchange process is performed or not. Only minor modifications to the conventional umbrella sampling method are necessary. However, the advantage of REUS over the umbrella sampling is significant, and the effectiveness was established with the system of an alanine trimer.},
