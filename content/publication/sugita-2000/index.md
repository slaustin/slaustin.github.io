abstract: A multidimensional extension of the original replica-exchange method is
  presented. One example of this approach is the combination of the replica-exchange
  method with the umbrella sampling, which the authors refer to as the replica-exchange
  umbrella sampling (REUS). While pairs of replicas with different temperatures are
  exchanged during the simulation in the original replica-exchange method, pairs of
  replicas with different temperatures and/or different biasing potential for the
  umbrella sampling are exchanged in REUS. This greatly enhances the sampling of the
  conformational space and allows accurate calculations of free energy in a wide temperature
  range from a single simulation run, using the weighted histogram analysis method.
  The difference between REUS and the conventional umbrella sampling is just whether
  the replica-exchange process is performed or not. Only minor modifications to the
  conventional umbrella sampling method are necessary. However, the advantage of REUS
  over the umbrella sampling is significant, and the effectiveness was established
  with the system of an alanine trimer.
