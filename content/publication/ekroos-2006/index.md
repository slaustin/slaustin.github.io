abstract: 'Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the most promiscuous of the human CYP enzymes
  and contributes to the metabolism of $≈$50% of marketed drugs. It is also the isoform
  most often involved in unwanted drug-drug interactions. A better understanding of
  the molecular mechanisms governing CYP3A4-ligand interaction therefore would be
  of great importance to any drug discovery effort. Here, we present crystal structures
  of human CYP3A4 in complex with two well characterized drugs: ketoconazole and erythromycin.
  In contrast to previous reports, the protein undergoes dramatic conformational changes
  upon ligand binding with an increase in the active site volume by $>$80%. The structures
  represent two distinct open conformations of CYP3A4 because ketoconazole and erythromycin
  induce different types of coordinate shifts. The binding of two molecules of ketoconazole
  to the CYP3A4 active site and the clear indication of multiple binding modes for
  erythromycin has implications for the interpretation of the atypical kinetic data
  often displayed by CYP3A4. The extreme flexibility revealed by the present structures
  also challenges any attempt to apply computational design tools without the support
  of relevant experimental data. o̧pyright 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences
