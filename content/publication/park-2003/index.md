abstract: Jarzynski's equality is applied to free energy calculations from steered
  molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules. The helix-coil transition of deca-alanine
  in vacuum is used as an example. With about ten trajectories sampled, the second
  order cumulant expansion, among the various averaging schemes examined, yields the
  most accurate estimates. We compare umbrella sampling and the present method, and
  find that their efficiencies are comparable.
