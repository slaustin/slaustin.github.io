abstract: The intrinsic dynamic properties of the ligand-binding pockets of proteins
  are important for the protein function mechanism and thus are useful to drug discovery
  and development. Few methods are available to study the dynamic properties, such
  as pocket stability, continuity, and correlation. In this work, we develop a method
  and web server, namely, D3Pockets, for exploring the dynamic properties of the protein
  pocket based on either molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories or conformational
  ensembles. Application of D3Pockets on five target proteins as examples, namely,
  HIV-1 protease, BACE1, L-ABP, GPX4, and GR, uncovers more information on the dynamic
  properties of the ligand-binding pockets, which should be helpful to understanding
  protein function mechanism and drug design. The D3Pockets web server is available
  at http://www.d3pharma.com/D3Pocket/index.php.
