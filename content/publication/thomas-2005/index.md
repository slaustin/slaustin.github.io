abstract: Beta-lactamase confers resistance to penicillin-like antibiotics by hydrolyzing
  their beta-lactam bond. To combat these enzymes, inhibitors covalently cross-linking
  the hydrolytic Ser70 to Ser130 were introduced. In turn, mutant beta-lactamases
  have emerged with decreased susceptibility to these mechanism-based inhibitors.
  Substituting Ser130 with glycine in the inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) mutant TEM-76
  (S130G) prevents the irreversible cross-linking step. Since the completely conserved
  Ser130 is thought to transfer a proton important for catalysis, its substitution
  might be hypothesized to result in a nonfunctional enzyme; this is clearly not the
  case. To investigate how TEM-76 remains active, its structure was determined by
  X-ray crystallography to 1.40 A resolution. A new water molecule (Wat1023) is observed
  in the active site, with two configurations located 1.1 and 1.3 A from the missing
  Ser130 Ogamma; this water molecule likely replaces the Ser130 side-chain hydroxyl
  in substrate hydrolysis. Intriguingly, this same water molecule is seen in the IRT
  TEM-32 (M69I/M182T), where Ser130 has moved significantly. TEM-76 shares other structural
  similarities with various IRTs; like TEM-30 (R244S) and TEM-84 (N276D), the water
  molecule activating clavulanate for cross-linking (Wat1614) is disordered (in TEM-30
  it is actually absent). As expected, TEM-76 has decreased kinetic activity, likely
  due to the replacement of the Ser130 side-chain hydroxyl with a water molecule.
  In contrast to the recently determined structure of the S130G mutant in the related
  SHV-1 beta-lactamase, in TEM-76 the key hydrolytic water (Wat1561) is still present.
  The conservation of similar accommodations among IRT mutants suggests that resistance
  arises from common mechanisms, despite the disparate locations of the various substitutions
