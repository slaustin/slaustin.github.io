abstract: Given the three-dimensional structure of a protein, how can one find the
  sites where other molecules might bind to it? Do these sites have the properties
  necessary for high affinity binding? Is this protein a suitable target for drug
  design? Here, we discuss recent developments in computational methods to address
  these and related questions. Geometric methods to identify pockets on protein surfaces
  have been developed over many years but, with new algorithms, their performance
  is still improving. Simulation methods show promise in accounting for protein conformational
  variability to identify transient pockets but lack the ease of use of many of the
  (rigid) shape-based tools. Sequence and structure comparison approaches are benefiting
  from the constantly increasing size of sequence and structure databases. Energetic
  methods can aid identification and characterization of binding pockets, and have
  undergone recent improvements in the treatment of solvation and hydrophobicity.
  The \"druggability\" of a binding site is still difficult to predict with an automated
  procedure. The methodologies available for this purpose range from simple shape
  and hydrophobicity scores to computationally demanding free energy simulations.
