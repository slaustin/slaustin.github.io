abstract: Picosecond time scale dynamics of hydrated proteins has been connected with
  the onset of biological activity as it coincides with solvent-solute hydrogen bond
  rearrangements and amino acid rotational relaxation time scales. The presence and
  fluctuations of protein hydration water (PHW) largely influence protein motions
  that are believed to be slaved to those of the solvent, yet to date, how protein
  and hydration water dynamics are coupled remains unclear. Here, we provide a significant
  advance in characterizing this coupling; we present the first full study of both
  the longitudinal and transverse coherent collective motions in a protein-solvent
  system. The data show unexpectedly the presence in the water dynamics of collective
  modes belonging to the protein. The properties of these modes, in particular, their
  propagation velocities and amplitudes, indicate a strengthening of the interactions
  and a higher rigidity of the network of solvent molecules close to the protein surface.
  Accordingly, the present study presents the most compelling and clear evidence of
  a very strong dynamical coupling between a protein and its hydration water, previously
  suggested by studies using various experimental techniques.
