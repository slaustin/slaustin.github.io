abstract: Intramolecular motions of proteins are critical for biological function.
  Transient structural fluctuations underlie a wide range of processes, including
  enzyme catalysis, ligand binding to buried sites, and generic protein motions, such
  as 180$^∘$ rotation of aromatic side chains in the protein interior, but remain
  poorly understood. Understanding the dynamics and molecular nature of concerted
  motions requires characterization of their rates and energy barriers. Here we use
  recently developed (13)C transverse relaxation dispersion methods to improve our
  current understanding of aromatic ring flips in basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
  (BPTI). We validate these methods by benchmarking ring-flip rates against the three
  previously characterized cases in BPTI, namely, Y23, Y35, and F45. Further, we measure
  conformational exchange for one additional aromatic ring, F22, which can be interpreted
  in terms of a flip rate of 666 s(-1) at 5 $^∘$C. Upon inclusion of our previously
  reported result that Y21 also flips slowly [Weininger, U., et al. (2013) J. Phys.
  Chem. B 117, 9241-9247], the (13)C relaxation dispersion experiments thus reveal
  relatively slow ring-flip rates for five of eight aromatic residues in BPTI. These
  results are in contrast with previous reports, which have estimated that all rings,
  except Y23, Y35, and F45, flip with a high rate at ambient temperature. The (13)C
  relaxation dispersion data result in an updated rank order of ring-flip rates in
  BPTI, which agrees considerably better with that estimated from a recent 1 ms molecular
  dynamics trajectory than do previously published NMR data. However, significant
  quantitative differences remain between experiment and simulation, in that the latter
  yields flip rates that are in many cases too fast by 1-2 orders of magnitude. By
  measuring flip rates across a temperature range of 5-65 $^∘$C, we determined the
  activation barriers of ring flips for Y23, Y35, and F45. Y23 and F45 have identical
  activation parameters, suggesting that the fluctuations of the protein core around
  these residues are similar in character. Y35 differs from the other two in its apparent
  activation entropy. These results might be rationalized by the fact that Y23 and
  F45 are located in the same region of the structure while Y35 is remote from the
  other two rings. As indicated by our new results for the exceptionally well-characterized
  protein BPTI, (13)C relaxation dispersion experiments open the possibility of studying
  ring flips in a range of cases wider than that previously possible.
