abstract: "Background: With long and costly drug development times there is a need
  in the pharmaceutical industry to prioritize targets early in the drug discovery
  process. One of the possible criteria is 'protein drugability', a term with multiple
  understandings in the literature. Among others, it is the likelihood of finding
  a selective, low-molecular weight molecule that binds with high affinity to the
  target. Objective: Which methods are available for drugability prediction? What
  can be achieved by such predictions and how can they influence the target prioritization
  process? Methods: The main focus is on sequence- and structure-related computational
  methods for drugability prediction, giving an overview on their background as well
  as their bias and limitations with an emphasis on the structural biology point of
  view. Results/conclusion: Structural drugability assessment presents one criterion
  for prioritization of a target portfolio by enabling classification of targets into
  low, average, or high drugability. oÌ§pyright 2008 Informa UK Ltd."
