abstract: Temporal system-mass-density fluctuation analysis was performed on liquid-water
  molecular-dynamics simulations at ambient pressure and 200 and 300 K, in three increasingly-large
  systems. A prominent mode in system-density fluctuations was observed at molecular-librational
  frequencies of ???600-800 cm-1 (with pronounced temperature dependence). This mode
  displayed marked system-size dependence, disappearing for larger systems. Persistent
  system-density fluctuations were clearly evident at 10-11 cm-1 for all systems and
  temperatures, with lower-amplitude ?????'overtones' evident only in larger systems.
  It is conjectured that this reflects ???3 ps timescales observed in earlier studies
  for dissipation of local-density fluctuations in liquid water in this 200-300 K
  temperature range.
