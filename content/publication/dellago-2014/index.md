abstract: As shown by Jarzynski, free energy differences between equilibrium states
  can be expressed in terms of the statistics of work carried out on a system during
  non-equilibrium transformations. This exact result, as well as the related Crooks
  fluctuation theorem, provide the basis for the computation of free energy differences
  from fast switching molecular dynamics simulations, in which an external parameter
  is changed at a finite rate, driving the system away from equilibrium. In this article,
  we first briefly review the Jarzynski identity and the Crooks fluctuation theorem
  and then survey various algorithms building on these relations. We pay particular
  attention to the statistical efficiency of these methods and discuss practical issues
  arising in their implementation and the analysis of the results.
