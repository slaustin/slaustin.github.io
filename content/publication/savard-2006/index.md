abstract: Backbone dynamics of TEM-1 beta-lactamase (263 amino acids, 28.9 kDa) were
  studied by 15N nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation at 11.7, 14.1, and 18.8 T.
  The high quality of the spectra allowed us to measure the longitudinal relaxation
  rate (R1), the transverse relaxation rate (R2), and the 1H-15N NOE for up to 227
  of the 250 potentially observable backbone amide groups. The model-free formalism
  was used to determine internal motional parameters using an axially anisotropic
  model. TEM-1 exhibits a small prolate axial anisotropy (D(parallel)/D(perpendicular)
  = 1.23 +/- 0.01) and a global correlation time (tau(m)) of 12.41 +/- 0.01 ns. The
  unusually high average generalized order parameter (S2) of 0.90 +/- 0.02 indicates
  that TEM-1 is one of the most ordered proteins studied by liquid-state NMR to date.
  Although the omega-loop has a high degree of order in the picosecond-to-nanosecond
  time scale (mean S2 value of 0.90 +/- 0.02), we observed the presence of microsecond-to-millisecond
  time scale motions for this loop, as for the vicinity of the active site. These
  motions could be relevant for the catalytic function of TEM-1. Amide exchange experiments
  were also performed, and several amide groups were not exchanged after 12 days,
  an indication that global motions in TEM-1 are also very limited. Although detailed
  dynamics characterization by NMR cannot be readily applied to TEM-1 in the presence
  of relevant substrates, the unusual picosecond-to-nanosecond dynamics behavior of
  TEM-1 presented here will be essential to the validation and improvement of future
  molecular dynamics simulations of TEM-1 in the presence of functionally relevant
  substrates.
