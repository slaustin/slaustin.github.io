 abstract = {Backbone dynamics of TEM-1 beta-lactamase (263 amino acids, 28.9 kDa) were studied by 15N nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation at 11.7, 14.1, and 18.8 T. The high quality of the spectra allowed us to measure the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), the transverse relaxation rate (R2), and the \1H\-15N NOE for up to 227 of the 250 potentially observable backbone amide groups. The model-free formalism was used to determine internal motional parameters using an axially anisotropic model. TEM-1 exhibits a small prolate axial anisotropy (D(parallel)/D(perpendicular) = 1.23 +/- 0.01) and a global correlation time (tau(m)) of 12.41 +/- 0.01 ns. The unusually high average generalized order parameter (S2) of 0.90 +/- 0.02 indicates that TEM-1 is one of the most ordered proteins studied by liquid-state NMR to date. Although the omega-loop has a high degree of order in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale (mean S2 value of 0.90 +/- 0.02), we observed the presence of microsecond-to-millisecond time scale motions for this loop, as for the vicinity of the active site. These motions could be relevant for the catalytic function of TEM-1. Amide exchange experiments were also performed, and several amide groups were not exchanged after 12 days, an indication that global motions in TEM-1 are also very limited. Although detailed dynamics characterization by NMR cannot be readily applied to TEM-1 in the presence of relevant substrates, the unusual picosecond-to-nanosecond dynamics behavior of TEM-1 presented here will be essential to the validation and improvement of future molecular dynamics simulations of TEM-1 in the presence of functionally relevant substrates.},
