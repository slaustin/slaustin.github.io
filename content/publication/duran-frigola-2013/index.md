abstract: Structural systems pharmacology offers a novel way of approaching drug discovery
  by considering the global physiological environment of protein targets, and the
  effects derived of tinkering with them, without losing the key molecular details.
  In this article, we review some recent advances in the structural annotation of
  cell networks and discuss their potential impact on some of the hottest areas of
  drug development. In particular, we analyze recent structure-based strategies to
  target networks, protein interaction interfaces and allosteric sites, and how they
  will help in the development of more potent and specific treatments. Finally, we
  propose that mapping genetic variations onto protein networks, beyond the pharmacological
  targets, can rationalize interindividual variability in drug response, giving valuable
  hints to advance toward personalized medicine. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
