abstract: Cavities on a proteins surface as well as specific amino acid positioning
  within it create the physicochemical properties needed for a protein to perform
  its function. CASTp (http://cast.engr.uic.edu) is an online tool that locates and
  measures pockets and voids on 3D protein structures. This new version of CASTp includes
  annotated functional information of specific residues on the protein structure.
  The annotations are derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), Swiss-Prot, as well
  as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the latter contains information on
  the variant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are known to cause disease.
  These annotated residues are mapped to surface pockets, interior voids or other
  regions of the PDB structures. We use a semi-global pair-wise sequence alignment
  method to obtain sequence mapping between entries in Swiss-Prot, OMIM and entries
  in PDB. The updated CASTp web server can be used to study surface features, functional
  regions and specific roles of key residues of proteins. oÌ§pyright The Author 2006.
