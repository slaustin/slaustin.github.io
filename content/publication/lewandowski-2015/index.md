abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of physical biology is to understand the
  relationship between protein dynamics and function. At physiological temperatures,
  functional motions arise from the complex interplay of thermal motions of proteins
  and their environments. Here, we determine the hierarchy in the protein conformational
  energy landscape that underlies these motions, based on a series of temperature-dependent
  magic-angle spinning multinuclear nuclear-magnetic-resonance relaxation measurements
  in a hydrated nanocrystalline protein. The results support strong coupling between
  protein and solvent dynamics above 160 kelvin, with fast solvent motions, slow protein
  side-chain motions, and fast protein backbone motions being activated consecutively.
  Low activation energy, small-amplitude local motions dominate at low temperatures,
  with larger-amplitude, anisotropic, and functionally relevant motions involving
  entire peptide units becoming dominant at temperatures above 220 kelvin.
