abstract: The discovery of drug-like molecules that bind pockets in proteins that
  are not present in crystallographic structures yet exert allosteric control over
  activity has generated great interest in designing pharmaceuticals that exploit
  allosteric effects. However, there have only been a small number of successes, so
  the therapeutic potential of these pockets-called hidden allosteric sites-remains
  unclear. One challenge for assessing their utility is that rational drug design
  approaches require foreknowledge of the target site, but most hidden allosteric
  sites are only discovered when a small molecule is found to stabilize them. We present
  a means of decoupling the identification of hidden allosteric sites from the discovery
  of drugs that bind them by drawing on new developments in Markov state modeling
  that provide unprecedented access to microsecond- to millisecond-timescale fluctuations
  of a protein's structure. Visualizing these fluctuations allows us to identify potential
  hidden allosteric sites, which we then test via thiol labeling experiments. Application
  of these methods reveals multiple hidden allosteric sites in an important antibiotic
  target-TEM-1 $Î²$-lactamase. This result supports the hypothesis that there are many
  as yet undiscovered hidden allosteric sites and suggests our methodology can identify
  such sites, providing a starting point for future drug design efforts. More generally,
  our results demonstrate the power of using Markov state models to guide experiments.
