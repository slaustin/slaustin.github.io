abstract: The ability to inhibit binding or enzymatic activity is key to preventing
  aberrant behaviors of proteins. Allosteric inhibition is desirable as it offers
  several advantages over competitive inhibition, but the mechanisms of action remain
  poorly understood in most cases. Here we show that allosteric inhibition can be
  effected by destabilizing a low-populated conformational state that serves as an
  on-pathway intermediate for ligand binding, without altering the protein's ground-state
  structure. As standard structural approaches are typically concerned with changes
  in the ground-state structure of proteins, the presence of such a mechanism can
  go easily undetected. Our data strongly argue for the routine use of NMR tools suited
  to detect and characterize transiently formed conformational states in allosteric
  systems. Structure information on such important intermediates can ultimately result
  in more efficient design of allosteric inhibitors.
