abstract: Kinase inhibitors are important cancer drugs, but they tend to display limited
  target specificity, and their target profiles are often challenging to rationalize
  in terms of molecular mechanism. Here we report that the clinical kinase inhibitor
  bosutinib recognizes its kinase targets by engaging a pair of conserved structured
  water molecules in the active site and that many other kinase inhibitors share a
  similar recognition mechanism. Using the nitrile group of bosutinib as an infrared
  probe, we show that the gatekeeper residue and one other position in the ATP-binding
  site control access of the drug to the structured water molecules and that the amino
  acids found at these positions account for the kinome-wide target spectrum of the
  drug. Our work highlights the importance of structured water molecules for inhibitor
  recognition, reveals a new role for the kinase gatekeeper and showcases an effective
  approach for elucidating the molecular origins of selectivity patterns.
