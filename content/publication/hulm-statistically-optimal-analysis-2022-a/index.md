abstract: The extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) method and its newer variants
  offer rapid exploration of the configuration space of chemical systems. Instead
  of directly applying the ABF bias to collective variables, they are harmonically
  coupled to fictitious particles, which separates the problem of enhanced sampling
  from that of free energy estimation. The prevalent analysis method to obtain the
  potential of mean force (PMF) from eABF is thermodynamic integration. However, besides
  the PMF, most information is lost as the unbiased probability of visited configurations
  is never recovered. In this contribution, we show how statistical weights of individual
  frames can be computed using the Multistate Bennett's Acceptance Ratio (MBAR), putting
  the post-processing of eABF on one level with other frequently used sampling methods.
  In addition, we apply this formalism to the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance
  shieldings, which are very sensitive to molecular geometries and often require extensive
  sampling. The results show that the combination of enhanced sampling by means of
  extended-system dynamics with the MBAR estimator is a highly useful tool for the
  calculation of ensemble properties. Furthermore, the extension of the presented
  scheme to the recently published Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics eABF hybrid
  is straightforward and approximation free.
