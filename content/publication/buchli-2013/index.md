abstract: By covalently linking an azobenzene photoswitch across the binding groove
  of a PDZ domain, a conformational transition, similar to the one occurring upon
  ligand binding to the unmodified domain, can be initiated on a picosecond timescale
  by a laser pulse. The protein structures have been characterized in the two photoswitch
  states through NMR spectroscopy and the transition between them through ultrafast
  IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding groove opens on
  a 100-ns timescale in a highly nonexponential manner, and the molecular dynamics
  simulations suggest that the process is governed by the rearrangement of the water
  network on the protein surface. We propose this rearrangement of the water network
  to be another possible mechanism of allostery.
