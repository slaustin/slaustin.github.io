abstract: Proteins can bind target molecules through either induced fit or conformational
  selection pathways. In the conformational selection model, a protein samples a scarcely
  populated high-energy state that resembles a target-bound conformation. In enzymatic
  catalysis, such high-energy states have been identified as crucial entities for
  activity and the dynamic interconversion between ground states and high-energy states
  can constitute the rate-limiting step for catalytic turnover. The transient nature
  of these states has precluded direct observation of their properties. Here, we present
  a molecular description of a high-energy enzyme state in a conformational selection
  pathway by an experimental strategy centered on NMR spectroscopy, protein engineering,
  and X-ray crystallography. Through the introduction of a disulfide bond, we succeeded
  in arresting the enzyme adenylate kinase in a closed high-energy conformation that
  is on-pathway for catalysis. A 1.9-Å X-ray structure of the arrested enzyme in complex
  with a transition state analog shows that catalytic sidechains are properly aligned
  for catalysis. We discovered that the structural sampling of the substrate free
  enzyme corresponds to the complete amplitude that is associated with formation of
  the closed and catalytically active state. In addition, we found that the trapped
  high-energy state displayed improved ligand binding affinity, compared with the
  wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that substrate binding to the high-energy state
  is not occluded by steric hindrance. Finally, we show that quenching of fast time
  scale motions observed upon ligand binding to adenylate kinase is dominated by enzyme--substrate
  interactions and not by intramolecular interactions resulting from the conformational
  change.
