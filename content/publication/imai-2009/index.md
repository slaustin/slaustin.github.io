abstract: In line with the recent development of fragment-based drug design, a new
  computational method for mapping of small ligand molecules on protein surfaces is
  proposed. The method uses three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution functions
  of the atomic sites of the ligand calculated using the molecular theory of solvation,
  known as the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory, to identify the
  most probable binding modes of ligand molecules. The 3D-RISM-based method is applied
  to the binding of several small organic molecules to thermolysin, in order to show
  its efficiency and accuracy in detecting binding sites. The results demonstrate
  that our method can reproduce the major binding modes found by X-ray crystallographic
  studies with sufficient precision. Moreover, the method can successfully identify
  some binding modes associated with a known inhibitor, which could not be detected
  by X-ray analysis. The dependence of ligand-binding modes on the ligand concentration,
  which essentially cannot be treated with other existing computational methods, is
  also investigated. The results indicate that some binding modes are readily affected
  by the ligand concentration, whereas others are not significantly altered. In the
  former case, it is the subtle balance in the binding affinity between the ligand
  and water that determines the dominant ligand-binding mode. oÌ§pyright 2009 American
