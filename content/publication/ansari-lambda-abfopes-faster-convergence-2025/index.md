abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target macromolecules
  while combining both speed and accuracy, is a cornerstone of modern computational
  drug discovery which is critical for accelerating therapeutic development. Despite
  recent progresses in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as advanced polarizable
  force fields and enhanced-sampling techniques, estimating absolute binding free
  energies (ABFE) remains computationally challenging. To overcome these difficulties,
  we introduce a highly efficient, hybrid methodology that couples the Lambda-Adaptive
  Biasing Force (Lambda-ABF) scheme with On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling
  (OPES). This approach achieves up to a nine-fold improvement in sampling efficiency
  and computational speed compared to the original Lambda-ABF when used in conjunction
  with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, yielding converged results at a fraction
  of the cost of standard techniques.
