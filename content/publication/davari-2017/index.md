abstract: 'Recently, the quick spreads of broad-spectrum beta-lactams antibiotic resistance
  in pathogenic strains of bacteria have become a major global health problem. These
  new emerging resistances cause ineffectiveness of antibiotics and increasing the
  severity of diseases and treatment costs. Among different and diverse resistance
  targets, we chose a class A beta lactamase, CTX-M-9, with the aim of identifying
  new chemical entities to be used for further rational drug design. Based on this
  purpose, a set of 5000 molecules from the Zinc database have been screened by docking
  experiments using AutoDock Vina software. The best ranked compound, with respect
  of the previously proved inhibitor compound 19, was further tested by molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulation. Our molecular modeling analysis demonstrates that ZINC33264777
  has ideal characteristics a potent beta lactamase CTX-M-9 inhibitor. In the free
  form of beta lactamase, NMR relaxation studies showed the extensive motions near
  the active site and in the textohm-loop. However, our molecular dynamics studies
  revealed that in the compound 1: beta lactamase complex, the flexibility of textohm-loop
  was restricted.'
