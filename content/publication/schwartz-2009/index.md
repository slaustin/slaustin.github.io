abstract: What are the atomic motions at enzymatic catalytic sites on the timescale
  of chemical change? Combined experimental and computational chemistry approaches
  take advantage of transition-state analogs to reveal dynamic motions linked to transition-state
  formation. QM/MM transition path sampling from reactive complexes provides both
  temporal and dynamic information for barrier crossing. Fast (femtosecond to picosecond)
  dynamic motions provide essential links to enzymatic barrier crossing by local or
  promoting-mode dynamic searches through bond-vibrational space. Transition-state
  lifetimes are within the femtosecond timescales of bond vibrations and show no manifestations
  of stabilized, equilibrated complexes. The slow binding and protein conformational
  changes (microsecond to millisecond) also required for catalysis are temporally
  decoupled from the fast dynamic motions forming the transition state. According
  to this view of enzymatic catalysis, transition states are formed by fast, coincident
  dynamic excursions of catalytic site elements, while the binding of transition-state
  analogs is the conversion of the dynamic excursions to equilibrated states.
