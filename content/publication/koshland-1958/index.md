abstract: The suggestion of Lipmann' that the energy required to drive this reaction
  to the right came from adenosine triphosphate has been supported by the extensive
  work2 which has been discussed by the previous speakers on this symposium. While
  the detailed mechanism of this energy transfer has not been fully elucidated, the
  ATP apparently forms an amino acid anhydride. The fact that an anhydride of rela-
  tively high-energy content is the method of driving the reaction thermodynamically
  fits in with organic practice in which acyl anhydrides are the usual reagents for
  acylations. In addition to thermodynamic activation, there is a needed \"kinetic
  activation.\" For example, the acyl phosphates and acyl adenylates acylate amines
  non-enzymatically at appreciable rates in aqueous solution, but this reaction is
  certainly not rapid enough or selective enough to account for protein synthesis.
  The reaction of these acyl anhydrides to form peptides must be catalyzed, and it
  is this catalysis which is the subject of this paper.
