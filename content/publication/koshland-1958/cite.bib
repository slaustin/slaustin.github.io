 abstract = {The suggestion of Lipmann' that the energy required to drive this reaction to the right came from adenosine triphosphate has been supported by the extensive work2 which has been discussed by the previous speakers on this symposium. While the detailed mechanism of this energy transfer has not been fully elucidated, the ATP apparently forms an amino acid anhydride. The fact that an anhydride of rela- tively high-energy content is the method of driving the reaction thermodynamically fits in with organic practice in which acyl anhydrides are the usual reagents for acylations. In addition to thermodynamic activation, there is a needed "kinetic activation." For example, the acyl phosphates and acyl adenylates acylate amines non-enzymatically at appreciable rates in aqueous solution, but this reaction is certainly not rapid enough or selective enough to account for protein synthesis. The reaction of these acyl anhydrides to form peptides must be catalyzed, and it is this catalysis which is the subject of this paper.},
