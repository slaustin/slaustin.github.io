abstract: "Background: Adenylate kinases undergo large conformational changes during
  their catalytic cycle. Because these changes have been studied by comparison of
  structures from different species, which share approximately one-third of their
  residues, only rough descriptions have been possible to date. Results We have solved
  the structure of unligated adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli at 2.2 å resolution
  and compared it with the high-resolution structure of the same enzyme ligated with
  an inhibitor mimicking both substrates, ATP and AMP. This comparison shows that,
  upon substrate binding, the enzyme increases its chain mobility in a region remote
  from the active center. As this region `solidifies' again on substrate release,
  we propose that it serves as a `counterweight' balancing the substrate binding energy.
  Conclusion The comparison of two very different conformations of the same polypeptide
  chain revealed kinematic details of the catalytic cycle. Moreover, it indicated
  that there exists an energetic counterweight compensating the substrate binding
  energy required for specificity. This counterweight prevents the enzyme from dropping
  into a rate-reducing energy well along the reaction coordinate."
