abstract: Many biological processes depend on allosteric communication between different
  parts of a protein, but the role of internal protein motion in propagating signals
  through the structure remains largely unknown. Through an experimental and computational
  analysis of the ground state dynamics in ubiquitin, we identify a collective global
  motion that is specifically linked to a conformational switch distant from the binding
  interface. This allosteric coupling is also present in crystal structures and is
  found to facilitate multispecificity, particularly binding to the ubiquitin-specific
  protease (USP) family of deubiquitinases. The collectivemotion that enables this
  allosteric communication does not affect binding through localized changes but,
  instead, depends on expansion and contraction of the entire protein domain. The
  characterization of these collective motions represents a promising avenue for finding
  and manipulating allosteric networks.
