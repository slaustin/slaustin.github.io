abstract: The discovery of new allosteric sites generates opportunities for the identification
  of novel pharmaceuticals and increases our understanding of basic biological processes.
  Increasingly, allosteric sites are being discovered in various families of proteins
  by several methods, paving the way for the development of entirely new classes of
  drugs with a wide range of chemotypes. New allosteric sites in enzymes have been
  discovered both incidentally and by directed means, and the mechanisms by which
  allosteric activation and inhibition occur at these sites have been investigated.
  By exploring recent structurally well-characterized examples, trends begin to emerge
  for both the modes of binding and mechanisms of inhibition. oÌ§pyright 2004 Elsevier
