abstract: In a recent paper (J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 11339) the transversal diffusion
  of water moving away from a protein surface was considered. Here lateral diffusion
  of water along the protein has been studied. Residue and atom specific residence
  times of water molecules at the protein surface are analyzed. The largest rates
  of water molecules leaving the protein surface layer can be found at charged residues.
  Simultaneously, there are often water molecules which stick to the charged atoms.
  However, in relation to the surface-covered area water molecules are most likely
  leaving the protein surface at hydrophobic residues. ? 1995 American Chemical Society.
