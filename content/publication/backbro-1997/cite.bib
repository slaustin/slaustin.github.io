 abstract = {Two cyclic, C2-symmetric HIV-1 protease inhibitors, one sulfamide and one urea derivative, both comprising phenyl ether groups in the P1/P1' positions, were cocrystallized with HIV-1 protease, and the crystal structures were determined to 2.0 Å resolution. The structure of the urea 2 showed a conformation similar to that reported for the related urea 3 by Lam et al., while the sulfamide 1 adopted an unanticipated conformation in which the P1' and P2' side chains were transposed.},
