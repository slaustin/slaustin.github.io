abstract: The structure of the protein-solvent interface is the subject of controversy
  in theoretical studies and requires direct experimental characterization. Three
  proteins with known atomic resolution crystal structure (lysozyme, Escherichia coli
  thioredoxin reductase, and protein R1 of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase) were
  investigated in parallel by x-ray and neutron scattering in H2O add D2O solutions.
  The analysis of the protein-solvent interface is based on the significantly different
  contrasts for the protein and for the hydration shell. The results point to the
  existence of a first hydration shell with an average density $âˆ¼eq$10% larger than
  that of the bulk solvent in the conditions studied. Comparisons with the results
  of other studies suggest that this may be a general property of aqueous interfaces.
