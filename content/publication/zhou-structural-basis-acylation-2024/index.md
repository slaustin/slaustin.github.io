abstract: Coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) are critical for viral replication
  and provide targets for antiviral drugs. Using the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus
  porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model, we determined the crystal structure
  of an inactive PEDV 3CLpro variant (C144A) in complex with a peptide of NF-$Ä…ppa$B
  essential modulator (NEMO227--233). Structural characterization showed that the
  conformational change to PEDV 3CLpro S1$prime$ pocket conferred tolerance for nonconventional
  P1$prime$-Val from a NEMO peptide substrate, indicating strong substrate accommodation.
  Using a combination of classical and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations,
  we explored the free-energy landscapes associated with the acylation step of PEDV
  3CLpro with regard to various substrates. The P1$prime$ site plays a key role in
  the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteolysis, and the S1$prime$ pocket might affect
  the free-energy cost of the acylation reaction. Our study provides structural insight
  into coronavirus 3CLpro-mediated cleavage and will inform the development of anti-coronavirus
  drugs.
