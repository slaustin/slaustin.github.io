 abstract = {Coronavirus 3C-like proteases (3CLpro) are critical for viral replication and provide targets for antiviral drugs. Using the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) as a model, we determined the crystal structure of an inactive PEDV 3CLpro variant (C144A) in complex with a peptide of NF-$Ä…ppa$B essential modulator (NEMO227--233). Structural characterization showed that the conformational change to PEDV 3CLpro S1$\prime$ pocket conferred tolerance for nonconventional P1$\prime$-Val from a NEMO peptide substrate, indicating strong substrate accommodation. Using a combination of classical and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, we explored the free-energy landscapes associated with the acylation step of PEDV 3CLpro with regard to various substrates. The P1$\prime$ site plays a key role in the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteolysis, and the S1$\prime$ pocket might affect the free-energy cost of the acylation reaction. Our study provides structural insight into coronavirus 3CLpro-mediated cleavage and will inform the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.},
