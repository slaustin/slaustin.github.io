abstract: A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating
  such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual
  molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration
  over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have
  been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are
  compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient
  expansion.
