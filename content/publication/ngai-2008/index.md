abstract: Hydrated proteins undergo a change in their dynamical properties in the
  neighborhood of a temperature. The change of dynamics has been likened to glass
  transition of glass-forming substances because similar properties were found. However,
  a complete understanding of the conformation fluctuations of hydrated proteins and
  their relation to the dynamics of the solvent is still not available, possibly due
  to the protein molecules being more complex than ordinary glass-formers. For this
  reason, we turn our attention to the experimental findings of the dynamics of mixtures
  of water with simpler glass-formers (small molecules and polymers). Two major relaxation
  processes have been observed in these aqueous mixtures. One is the structural alpha-relaxation
  of the hydrophilic glass-former hydrogen bonded to the water, which is responsible
  for glass transition. The other one is the local secondary beta-relaxation of water
  in the mixture. Remarkably, these two relaxation processes in aqueous mixtures have
  analogues in hydrated proteins with the same properties. The conformation fluctuations
  of the protein and the relaxation of the solvent in hydrated proteins behave like
  the alpha-relaxation of the hydrophilic glass-former hydrogen bonded to the water
  and the beta-relaxation of water in other aqueous mixtures, respectively. At low
  temperatures, the Arrhenius activation energy of the relaxation time of the solvent
  in a hydrated protein is almost the same as that of the beta-relaxation of water
  in the glassy states of aqueous mixtures. The Arrhenius T-dependence of the solvent
  relaxation times no longer holds at temperatures that exceed the \"glass\" transition
  temperature of the hydrated protein, defined as the temperature at which the conformation
  relaxation time is very long. This behavior of the solvent in hydrated proteins
  is similar to that found in the beta-relaxation of water in aqueous mixtures when
  crossing the glass transition temperature of the mixture (Capaccioli, S.; Ngai,
  K. L.; Shinyashiki, N. J. Phys. Chem. B 2007, 111, 8197). Furthermore, the same
  dynamics were found in mixtures of two van der Waals glass-formers, which are even
  simpler systems than aqueous mixtures because of the absence of hydrogen bonding.
  The experimental data of these ideal mixtures of van der Waals glass-formers have
  been given a satisfactory theoretical explanation. Since the properties of hydrated
  proteins, aqueous mixtures, and the mixtures of van der Waals liquids are similar,
  we transfer the theoretical understanding gained in the study of the last system
  sequentially to the two other increasingly more complex systems.
