abstract: Obesity and type II diabetes are closely linked metabolic syndromes that
  afflict $>$100 million people worldwide. Although protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B
  (PTP1B) has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of both syndromes, the
  discovery of pharmaceutically acceptable inhibitors that bind at the active site
  remains a substantial challenge. Here we describe the discovery of an allosteric
  site in PTP1B. Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with allosteric inhibitors
  reveal a novel site located approximately 20 A from the catalytic site. We show
  that allosteric inhibitors prevent formation of the active form of the enzyme by
  blocking mobility of the catalytic loop, thereby exploiting a general mechanism
  used by tyrosine phosphatases. Notably, these inhibitors exhibit selectivity for
  PTP1B and enhance insulin signaling in cells. Allosteric inhibition is a promising
  strategy for targeting PTP1B and constitutes a mechanism that may be applicable
  to other tyrosine phosphatases.
