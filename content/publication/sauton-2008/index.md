abstract: 'Background: The number of protein targets with a known or predicted tri-dimensional
  structure and of drug-like chemical compounds is growing rapidly and so is the need
  for new therapeutic compounds or chemical probes. Performing flexible structure-based
  virtual screening computations on thousands of targets with millions of molecules
  is intractable to most laboratories nor indeed desirable. Since shape complementarity
  is of primary importance for most protein-ligand interactions, we have developed
  a tool/protocol based on rigid-body docking to select compounds that fit well into
  binding sites. Results: Here we present an efficient multiple conformation rigid-body
  docking approach, MS-DOCK, which is based on the program DOCK. This approach can
  be used as the first step of a multi-stage docking/scoring protocol. First, we developed
  and validated the Multiconf-DOCK tool that generates several conformers per input
  ligand. Then, each generated conformer (bioactives and 37970 decoys) was docked
  rigidly using DOCK6 with our optimized protocol into seven different receptor-binding
  sites. MS-DOCK was able to significantly reduce the size of the initial input library
  for all seven targets, thereby facilitating subsequent more CPU demanding flexible
  docking procedures. Conclusion: MS-DOCK can be easily used for the generation of
  multi-conformer libraries and for shape-based filtering within a multi-step structure-based
  screening protocol in order to shorten computation times. oÌ§pyright 2008 Sauton
