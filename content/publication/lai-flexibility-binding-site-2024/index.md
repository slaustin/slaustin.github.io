abstract: High binding affinity and selectivity of metal ions are essential to the
  function of metalloproteins. Thus, understanding the factors that determine these
  binding characteristics is of major interest for both fundamental mechanistic investigations
  and guiding of the design of novel metalloproteins. In this work, we perform QM
  cluster model calculations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free
  energy simulations to understand the binding selectivity of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the
  wild-type carp parvalbumin and its mutant. While a nonpolarizable MM model (CHARMM36)
  does not lead to the correct experimental trend, treatment of the metal binding
  site with the DFTB3 model in a QM/MM framework leads to relative binding free energies
  ($ΔΔ$Gbind) comparable with experimental data. For the wild-type (WT) protein, the
  calculated $ΔΔ$Gbind is $∼$6.6 kcal/mol in comparison with the experimental value
  of 5.6 kcal/mol. The good agreement highlights the value of a QM description of
  the metal binding site and supports the role of electronic polarization and charge
  transfer to metal binding selectivity. For the D51A/E101D/F102W mutant, different
  binding site models lead to considerable variations in computed binding affinities.
  With a coordination number of seven for Ca2+, which is shown by QM/MM metadynamics
  simulations to be the dominant coordination number for the mutant, the calculated
  relative binding affinity is $∼$4.8 kcal/mol, in fair agreement with the experimental
  value of 1.6 kcal/mol. The WT protein is observed to feature a flexible binding
  site that accommodates a range of coordination numbers for Ca2+, which is essential
  to the high binding selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+. In the mutant, the E101D mutation
  reduces the flexibility of the binding site and limits the dominant coordination
  number of Ca2+ to be seven, thereby leading to reduced binding selectivity against
  Mg2+. Our results highlight that the binding selectivity of metal ions depends on
  both the structural and dynamical properties of the protein binding site.
