 abstract = {The structure of form II crystals of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor has been investigated by joint refinement of X-ray and neutron data. Crystallographic R factors for the final model were 0$·$200 for the X-ray data extending to 1 Å resolution and 0$·$197 for the 1$·$8 Å neutron data. This model was strongly restrained, with 0$·$020 Å root-mean-square (r.m.s.) departure of bond lengths from their ideal values and 0$·$019 Å r.m.s. departure of planar groups from planarity. The resulting structure was very similar to that of crystal form I (r.m.s. deviation for main chain atoms was 0$·$40 Å); nevertheless larger deviations were observed in particular regions of the chain. Twenty out of 63 ordered water molecules occupy similar positions (deviation less than 1 Å) in both models. Eleven amide hydrogens were found to be protected from exchange after three months of soaking the crystals in deuterated mother liquor at pH 8$·$2. Their locations were in excellent agreement with the results obtained by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, but the rates of exchange are much lower in the crystalline state. o̧pyright 1984 Academic Press Inc.
