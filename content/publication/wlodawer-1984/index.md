abstract: The structure of form II crystals of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
  has been investigated by joint refinement of X-ray and neutron data. Crystallographic
  R factors for the final model were 0$·$200 for the X-ray data extending to 1 Å resolution
  and 0$·$197 for the 1$·$8 Å neutron data. This model was strongly restrained, with
  0$·$020 Å root-mean-square (r.m.s.) departure of bond lengths from their ideal values
  and 0$·$019 Å r.m.s. departure of planar groups from planarity. The resulting structure
  was very similar to that of crystal form I (r.m.s. deviation for main chain atoms
  was 0$·$40 Å); nevertheless larger deviations were observed in particular regions
  of the chain. Twenty out of 63 ordered water molecules occupy similar positions
  (deviation less than 1 Å) in both models. Eleven amide hydrogens were found to be
  protected from exchange after three months of soaking the crystals in deuterated
  mother liquor at pH 8$·$2. Their locations were in excellent agreement with the
  results obtained by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, but the rates of
  exchange are much lower in the crystalline state. o̧pyright 1984 Academic Press
