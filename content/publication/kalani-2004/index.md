abstract: Dopamine neurotransmitter and its receptors play a critical role in the
  cell signaling process responsible for information transfer in neurons functioning
  in the nervous system. Development of improved therapeutics for such disorders as
  Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia would be significantly enhanced with the availability
  of the 3D structure for the dopamine receptors and of the binding site for dopamine
  and other agonists and antagonists. We report here the 3D structure of the long
  isoform of the human D2 dopamine receptor, predicted from primary sequence using
  first-principles theoretical and computational techniques (i.e., we did not use
  bioinformatic or experimental 3D structural information in predicting structures).
  The predicted 3D structure is validated by comparison of the predicted binding site
  and the relative binding affinities of dopamine, three known dopamine agonists (antiparkinsonian),
  and seven known antagonists (antipsychotic) in the D2 receptor to experimentally
  determined values. These structures correctly predict the critical residues for
  binding dopamine and several antagonists, identified by mutation studies, and give
  relative binding affinities that correlate well with experiments. The predicted
  binding site for dopamine and agonists is located between transmembrane (TM) helices
  3, 4, 5, and 6, whereas the best antagonists bind to a site involving TM helices
  2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 with minimal contacts to TM helix 5. We identify characteristic
  differences between the binding sites of agonists and antagonists.
