abstract: "Background: Identification and evaluation of surface binding-pockets and
  occluded cavities are initial steps in protein structure-based drug design. Characterizing
  the active site's shape as well as the distribution of surrounding residues plays
  an important role for a variety of applications such as automated ligand docking
  or in situ modeling. Comparing the shape similarity of binding site geometries of
  related proteins provides further insights into the mechanisms of ligand binding.
  Results: We present PocketPicker, an automated grid-based technique for the prediction
  of protein binding pockets that specifies the shape of a potential binding-site
  with regard to its buriedness. The method was applied to a representative set of
  protein-ligand complexes and their corresponding opo-protein structures to evaluate
  the quality of binding-site predictions. The performance of the pocket detection
  routine was compared to results achieved with the existing methods CAST, LIGSITE,
  LIGSITE cs PASS and SURFNET. Success rates PocketPicker were comparable to those
  of LIGSITE cs and outperformed the other tools. We introduce a descriptor that translates
  the arrangement of grid points delineating a detected binding-site into a correlation
  vector. We show that this shape descriptor is suited for comparative analyses of
  similar binding-site geometry by examining induced-fit phenomena in aldose reductase.
  This new method uses information derived from calculations of the buriedness of
  potential binding-sites. Conclusion: The pocket prediction routine of PocketPicker
  is a useful tool for identification of potential protein binding-pockets. It produces
  a convenient representation of binding-site shapes including an intuitive description
  of their accessibility. The shape-descriptor for automated classification of binding-site
  geometries can be used as an additional tool complementing elaborate manual inspections."
