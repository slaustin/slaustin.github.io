abstract: A method is presented for finding particular normal modes for large molecules
  such as proteins and nucleic acids. The method is based on an iterative approach
  that extracts eigenvectors of interest from the full second-derivative matrix. Application
  of the method to the interdomain (hinge-bending) motion of lysozyme yields a frequency
  of 3.6 cm-1. This is similar to the value obtained from earlier adiabatic-energy-minimization
  studies. Analysis of the mode shows that the relaxation associated with the hinge
  bending is highly delocalized; that is, the dihedral angle and energy changes are
  distributed over many residues, including some (e.g., Trp-28) that are distant from
  the cleft and hinge region.
