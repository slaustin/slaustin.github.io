abstract: Structure and dynamic properties of liquid water at temperatures between
  298 and 523 K and densities between 0.75 and 1.20 g/cm3 have been investigated by
  molecular dynamics simulation. A flexible simple point charge potential has been
  asssumed for interactions. The hydrogen bonding structure in the different simulated
  states as well as the influence of the hydrogen bonds on the dynamic properties
  (self-diffusion coefficients, vibrational spectra) is discussed. Special attention
  is paid to the intermolecular vibrational spectrum (10--400 cm-1). It has been corroborated
  that the band around 200 cm-1 can be attributed to intermolecular O--O stretching
  vibrations of pairs of H-bonded bounded molecules. On the contrary, molecular dynamics
  results indicate that the band close to 50 cm-1 is independent of the existence
  of hydrogen bonds but depends on the density and temperature of the system. It is
  suggested that it is simply associated with vibrations of molecules in the cage
  formed by their neighbors. Shifts of librational and stretching bands as a function
  of the thermodynamic state are highly correlated with changes in the percentage
  of hydrogen bonded molecules.
