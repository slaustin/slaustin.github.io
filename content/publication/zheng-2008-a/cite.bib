 abstract = {In the past few decades, many ingenious efforts have been made in the development of free-energy simulation methods. Because complex systems often undergo nontrivial structural transition during state switching, achieving efficient free-energy calculation can be challenging. As identified earlier, the "Hamiltonian" lagging, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the order parameter move, has been a primary problem for generally low free-energy simulation efficiency. Here, we propose an algorithm by achieving a random walk in both the order parameter space and its generalized force space; thereby, the order parameter move and the required conformational relaxation can be efficiently synchronized. As demonstrated in both the alchemical transition and the conformational transition, a leapfrog improvement in free-energy simulation efficiency can be obtained; for instance, (i) it allows us to solve a notoriously challenging problem: accurately predicting the pKa value of a buried titratable residue, Asp-66, in the interior of the V66E staphylococcal nuclease mutant, and (ii) it allows us to gain superior efficiency over the metadynamics algorithm. oÌ§pyright 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},
