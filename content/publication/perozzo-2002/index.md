abstract: The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum synthesizes fatty acids
  using a type II pathway that is absent in humans. The final step in fatty acid elongation
  is catalyzed by enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase, a validated antimicrobial
  drug target. Here, we report the cloning and expression of the P. falciparum enoyl
  acyl carrier protein reductase gene, which encodes a 50-kDa protein (PfENR) predicted
  to target to the unique parasite apicoplast. Purified PfENR was crystallized, and
  its structure resolved as a binary complex with NADH, a ternary complex with triclosan
  and NAD+, and as ternary complexes bound to the triclosan analogs 1 and 2 with NADH.
  Novel structural features were identified in the PfENR binding loop region that
  most closely resembled bacterial homologs; elsewhere the protein was similar to
  ENR from the plant Brassica napus (root mean square for C$α$s, 0.30 Å). Triclosan
  and its analogs 1 and 2 killed multidrug-resistant strains of intra-erythrocytic
  P. falciparum parasites at sub to low micromolar concentrations in vitro. These
  data define the structural basis of triclosan binding to PfENR and will facilitate
  structure-based optimization of PfENR inhibitors.
