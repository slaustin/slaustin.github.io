abstract: Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and elastic and quasi-elastic neutron
  scattering techniques were used to investigate the high-pressure-induced changes
  on interactions, the low-resolution structure and the dynamics of lysozyme in solution.
  SAXS data, analysed using a global-fit procedure based on a new approach for hydrated
  protein form factor description, indicate that lysozyme completely maintains its
  globular structure up to 1500 bar, but significant modifications in the protein-protein
  interaction potential occur at approximately 600-1000 bar. Moreover, the mass density
  of the protein hydration water shows a clear discontinuity within this pressure
  range. Neutron scattering experiments indicate that the global and the local lysozyme
  dynamics change at a similar threshold pressure. A clear evolution of the internal
  protein dynamics from diffusing to more localized motions has also been probed.
  Protein structure and dynamics results have then been discussed in the context of
  protein-water interface and hydration water dynamics. According to SAXS results,
  the new configuration of water in the first hydration layer induced by pressure
  is suggested to be at the origin of the observed local mobility changes. oÌ§pyright
