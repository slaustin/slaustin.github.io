abstract: An information theoretic measure is derived that quantifies the statistical
  coherence between systems evolving in time. The standard time delayed mutual information
  fails to distinguish information that is actually exchanged from shared information
  due to common history and input signals. In our new approach, these influences are
  excluded by appropriate conditioning of transition probabilities. The resulting
  transfer entropy is able to distinguish effectively driving and responding elements
  and to detect asymmetry in the interaction of subsystems.
