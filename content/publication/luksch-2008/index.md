abstract: 'Plasmepsins (Plm) II (EC number: 3.4.23.39) and IV(EC number: 3.4.23.B14)
  are aspartic proteases present in the food vacuole of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
  falciparum and are involved in host hemoglobin degradation. Based on our established
  efficient synthetic sequence, a series of inhibitors for Plm II and IV has been
  synthesized bearing a 2,3,4,7-tetrahydro-1H-azepine scaffold as the core structural
  element. During the computational design cycle, thorough investigations were carried
  out in order to find a reasonable theoretical binding mode for Plm II and IV. The
  conformation of Plm II in the crystal structure (PDB code: 1LF2) provides a good
  starting geometry for our virtual screening approach. In contrast, the only available
  co-crystal structure for Plm IV of P. falciparum (PDB code: 1LS5) appears inappropriate
  for inhibitor design. Therefore, a homology model was constructed based on the Plm
  II 1LF2 structure. A combinatorial docking run using FlexXc suggested compounds
  which, after synthesis, turned out to exhibit affinities in the sub-micromolar range.
  The observed structure-activity relationships of the synthesized compounds confirm
  the assumed binding mode for Plm II and IV. The best-binding inhibitors designed
  for Plm II and IV are devoid of any inhibitory potency against human cathepsin D
  (EC number: 3.4.23.5). oÌ§pyright 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.'
