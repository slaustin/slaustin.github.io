 abstract = {Recent data have highlighted the enigmatic role that water plays in biomolecular complexes. Water at the interface of a complex can increase the promiscuity of an interaction, yet it can also provide increased specificity and affinity. The ability to engineer water-binding sites into the interface between a drug and its target might prove useful in drug design.},
