abstract: Recent data have highlighted the enigmatic role that water plays in biomolecular
  complexes. Water at the interface of a complex can increase the promiscuity of an
  interaction, yet it can also provide increased specificity and affinity. The ability
  to engineer water-binding sites into the interface between a drug and its target
  might prove useful in drug design.
