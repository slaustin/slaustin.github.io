abstract: While the quality of the current CHARMM22/CMAP additive force field for
  proteins has been demonstrated in a large number of applications, limitations in
  the model with respect to the equilibrium between the sampling of helical and extended
  conformations in folding simulations have been noted. To overcome this, as well
  as make other improvements in the model, we present a combination of refinements
  that should result in enhanced accuracy in simulations of proteins. The common (non-Gly,
  -Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR
  data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies
  of the $α$-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the $α$-helical
  bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate
  quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized
  by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by
  additional empirical optimization t...
