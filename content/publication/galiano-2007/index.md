abstract: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease, being responsible
  for the cleavage of the viral polyproteins gag and gag-pol, is an essential component
  in the processing of viral proteins encoded in the HIV viral genome. The present
  work utilizes site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and double electron-electron resonance
  (DEER) spectroscopy to characterize flap conformations in HIV-1 protease in an inhibited
  and uninhibited form. Because HIV protease is a homodimer, incorporation of the
  labeling probe at K55C yields a spin label pair within the protease, suitable for
  distance measurements by pulsed techniques. DEER experiments were performed with
  and without protease inhibitors to determine distances between residues 55-55- within
  the flap region of the protease. Analysis of the EPR results demonstrates that the
  flap region spans a continuous, rather than segmental, range of motion in its uninhibited
  state. Upon addition of inhibitor, the distance between spin labels shortens by-3-4
  Å (regardless of spin label choice), indicating a closing of the flaps. More importantly,
  these results characterize the range of flap opening in an uninhibited form, showing
  distances that span 26-48 Å, indicative of a broad range of possible conformations.
