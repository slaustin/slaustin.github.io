abstract: Localized water molecules in the binding pockets of proteins play an important
  role in noncovalent association of proteins and small drug compounds. At times,
  the dominant contribution to the binding free energy comes from the release of localized
  water molecules in the binding pockets of biomolecules. Therefore, to quantify the
  energetic importance of these water molecules for drug design purposes, we have
  used the double-decoupling approach to calculate the standard free energy of tying
  up a water molecule in the binding pockets of two protein complexes. The double-decoupling
  approach is based on the underlying principle of statistical thermodynamics. We
  have calculated the standard free energies of tying up the water molecule in the
  binding pockets of these complexes to be favorable. These water molecules stabilize
  the protein-drug complexes by interacting with the ligands and binding pockets.
  Our results offer ideas that could be used in optimizing protein-drug interactions,
  by designing ligands that are capable of targeting localized water molecules in
  protein binding sites. The resulting free energy of ligand binding could benefit
  from the potential free energy gain accompanying the release of these water molecules.
  Furthermore, we have examined the theoretical background of the double-decoupling
  method and its connection to the molecular dynamics thermodynamic integration techniques.
