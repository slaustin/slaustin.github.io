abstract: We study the structure of water through molecular dynamics, specifically
  the compression/expansion of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) network, with temperature
  and pressure, and in salt solutions of alkali chlorides and sodium halides, and
  relate the observed local spatial perturbations with the tetrahedrality and the
  average number and lifetime of water H-bonds. The effect of transient H-bonds and
  transient broken H-bonds on H-bond lifetimes is further investigated, and results
  are compared with depolarized Rayleigh scattering lifetimes for neat water. A significant
  electrostriction is observed in the first hydration shell of Li(+) and F(-), while
  larger ions cause a small expansion of the H-bond network of water instead. However,
  both alkali cations and halide anions induce a minor contraction of the H-bond network
  in the second hydration shell. Further, water in the second hydration shell of Li(+),
  Na(+), and K(+) is less tetrahedral than neat water, resembling water at high pressures,
  while the H-bond network in the respective hydration shell of halide anions resembles
  water at low temperatures. Nevertheless, neither ion induced H-bond contraction
  nor expansion can be exactly mapped onto P or T effects on the local structure of
  water. Even though the average number and lifetime of H-bonds in the ionic hydration
  shells of most ions are not very different from those found in neat water, Li(+)
  and F(-) significantly increase the lifetime of water donor and acceptor H-bonds,
  respectively, in the first hydration shell. The non-monotonic increase of cation
  and anion mobility, with ionic size, observed experimentally, is interpreted in
  terms of the water local tetrahedrality around cations and anions.
