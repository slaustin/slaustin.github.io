abstract: The first hydration shell of a protein exhibits heterogeneous behavior owing
  to several attributes, majorly local polarity and structural flexibility as revealed
  by solvation dynamics of secondary structural elements. We attempt to recognize
  the change in complex water counteraction generated due to substantial alteration
  in flexibility during protein complex formation. The investigation is carried out
  with the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of receptors, expressed
  by an array of immune cells, and interacting with SLAM-associated protein (SAP),
  composed of one SH2 domain. All atom molecular dynamics simulations are employed
  to the aqueous solutions of free SAP and SLAM-peptide bound SAP. We observed that
  water dynamics around different secondary structural elements became highly affected
  as well as nicely correlated with the SLAM-peptide induced change in structural
  rigidity obtained by thermodynamic quantification. A few instances of contradictory
  dynamic features of water to the change in structural flexibility are explained
  by means of occluded polar residues by the peptide. For $Î²$D, EFloop, and BGloop,
  both structural flexibility and solvent accessibility of the residues confirm the
  obvious contribution. Most importantly, we have quantified enhanced restriction
  in water dynamics around the second Fyn-binding site of the SAP due to SAP-SLAM
  complexation, even prior to the presence of Fyn. This observation leads to a novel
  argument that SLAM induced more restricted water molecules could offer more water
  entropic contribution during the subsequent Fyn binding and provide enhanced stability
  to the SAP-Fyn complex in the signaling cascade. Finally, SLAM induced water counteraction
  around the second binding site of the SAP sheds light on the allosteric property
  of the SAP, which becomes an integral part of the underlying signal transduction
  mechanism.
