abstract: Four water molecules confined in a small cavity of hen egg-white lysozyme
  were detected by means of the three-dimensional (3D) RISM theory, a statistical-mechanical
  theory of molecular solutions. This is the first theoretical realization of confined
  molecules in a protein without making nonsense tricks, such as placing the molecules
  in the space a priori. Possible impacts which the result may have on biochemistry
  and biophysics, including the molecular recognition, enzymatic reactions, etc.,
  are discussed. Copyright oÌ§pyright 2005 American Chemical Society.
