abstract: We introduce a powerful method for exploring the properties of the multidimensional
  free energy surfaces (FESs) of complex many-body systems by means of coarse-grained
  non-Markovian dynamics in the space defined by a few collective coordinates. A characteristic
  feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term
  that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and
  accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We
  demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a
  NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine
  in solution.
