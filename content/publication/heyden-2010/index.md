abstract: Solvation of molecules in water is at the heart of a myriad of molecular
  phenomena and of crucial importance to understanding such diverse issues as chemical
  reactivity or biomolecular function. Complementing well-established approaches,
  it has been shown that laser spectroscopy in the THz frequency domain offers new
  insights into hydration from small solutes to proteins. Upon introducing spatially-resolved
  analyses of the absorption cross section by simulations, the sensitivity of THz
  spectroscopy is traced back to characteristic distance-dependent modulations of
  absorption intensities for bulk water. The prominent peak at approximate to 200
  cm(-1) is dominated by first-shell dynamics, whereas a concerted motion involving
  the second solvation shell contributes most significantly to the absorption at about
  80 cm(-1) approximate to 2.4 THz. The latter can be understood in terms of an umbrella-like
  motion of two hydrogen-bonded tetrahedra along the connecting hydrogen bond axis.
  Thus, a modification of the hydrogen bond network, e. g., due to the presence of
  a solute, is expected to affect vibrational motion and THz absorption intensity
  at least on a length scale that corresponds to two layers of solvating water molecules.
  This result provides a molecular mechanism explaining the experimentally determined
  sensitivity of absorption changes in the THz domain in terms of distinct, solute-induced
  dynamical properties in solvation shells of (bio)molecules-even in the absence of
  well-defined resonances.
