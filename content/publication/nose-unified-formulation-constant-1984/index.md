abstract: 'Three recently proposed constant temperature molecular dynamics methods
  by: (i) Nosé (Mol. Phys., to be published); (ii) Hoover et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
  48, 1818 (1982)], and Evans and Morriss [Chem. Phys. 77, 63 (1983)]; and (iii) Haile
  and Gupta [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 3067 (1983)] are examined analytically via calculating
  the equilibrium distribution functions and comparing them with that of the canonical
  ensemble. Except for effects due to momentum and angular momentum conservation,
  method (i) yields the rigorous canonical distribution in both momentum and coordinate
  space. Method (ii) can be made rigorous in coordinate space, and can be derived
  from method (i) by imposing a specific constraint. Method (iii) is not rigorous
  and gives a deviation of order N -1/2 from the canonical distribution (N the number
  of particles). The results for the constant temperature-constant pressure ensemble
  are similar to the canonical ensemble case. o̧pyright 1984 American Institute of
