abstract: We describe and illustrate a simple procedure for identifying a liquid interface
  from atomic coordinates. In particular, a coarse-grained density field is constructed,
  and the interface is defined as a constant density surface for this coarse-grained
  field. In applications to a molecular dynamics simulation of liquid water, it is
  shown that this procedure provides instructive and useful pictures of liquid-vapor
  interfaces and of liquid-protein interfaces.
