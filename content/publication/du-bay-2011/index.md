abstract: 'Allosteric regulation is a key component of cellular communication, but
  the way in which information is passed from one site to another within a folded
  protein is not often clear. While backbone motions have long been considered essential
  for long-range information conveyance, side-chain motions have rarely been considered.
  In this work, we demonstrate their potential utility using Monte Carlo sampling
  of side-chain torsional angles on a fixed backbone to quantify correlations amongst
  side-chain inter-rotameric motions. Results indicate that long-range correlations
  of side-chain fluctuations can arise independently from several different types
  of interactions: steric repulsions, implicit solvent interactions, or hydrogen bonding
  and salt-bridge interactions. These robust correlations persist across the entire
  protein (up to 60 Ã… in the case of calmodulin) and can propagate long-range changes
  in side-chain variability in response to single residue perturbations.'
