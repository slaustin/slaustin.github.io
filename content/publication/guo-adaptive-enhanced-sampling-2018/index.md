abstract: A machine learning assisted method is presented for molecular simulation
  of systems with rugged free energy landscapes. The method is general and can be
  combined with other advanced sampling techniques. In the particular implementation
  proposed here, it is illustrated in the context of an adaptive biasing force approach
  where, rather than relying on discrete force estimates, one can resort to a self-regularizing
  artificial neural network to generate continuous, estimated generalized forces.
  By doing so, the proposed approach addresses several shortcomings common to adaptive
  biasing force and other algorithms. Specifically, the neural network enables (1)
  smooth estimates of generalized forces in sparsely sampled regions, (2) force estimates
  in previously unexplored regions, and (3) continuous force estimates with which
  to bias the simulation, as opposed to biases generated at specific points of a discrete
  grid. The usefulness of the method is illustrated with three different examples,
  chosen to highlight the wide range of applicability of the underlying concepts.
  In all three cases, the new method is found to enhance considerably the underlying
  traditional adaptive biasing force approach. The method is also found to provide
  improvements over previous implementations of neural network assisted algorithms.
