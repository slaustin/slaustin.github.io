abstract: The conformational flexibility of target proteins continues to be a major
  challenge in accurate modeling of protein-inhibitor interactions. A fundamental
  issue, yet to be clarified, is whether the observed conformational changes are controlled
  by the protein or induced by the inhibitor. Although the concept of induced fit
  has been widely adopted for describing the structural changes that accompany ligand
  binding, there is growing evidence in support of the dominance of proteins' intrinsic
  dynamics which has been evolutionarily optimized to accommodate its functional interactions.
  The wealth of structural data for target proteins in the presence of different ligands
  now permits us to make a critical assessment of the balance between these two effects
  in selecting the bound forms. We focused on three widely studied drug targets, HIV-1
  reverse transcriptase, p38 MAP kinase, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. A total of
  292 structures determined for these enzymes in the presence of different inhibitors
  and unbound form permitted us to perform an extensive comparative analysis of the
  conformational space accessed upon ligand binding, and its relation to the intrinsic
  dynamics before ligand binding as predicted by elastic network model analysis. Our
  results show that the ligand selects the conformer that best matches its structural
  and dynamic properties among the conformers intrinsically accessible to the protein
  in the unliganded form. The results suggest that simple but robust rules encoded
  in the protein structure play a dominant role in predefining the mechanisms of ligand
  binding, which may be advantageously exploited in designing inhibitors.
