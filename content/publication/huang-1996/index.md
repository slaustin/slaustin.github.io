abstract: TEM-1 $β$-lactamase catalyzes the hydrolysis of $β$-lactam antibiotics such
  as the penicillins and cephalosporins, thus providing for bacterial resistance to
  these compounds. To determine the amino acid residues critical for the structure
  and function of TEM-1 $β$-lactamase, the codons for each of the 263 amino acid residues
  that constitute the mature form of the enzyme were randomized using a site-directed
  mutagenesis procedure. Functional random mutants were selected based on their ability
  to confer ampicillin resistance to Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of several
  functional mutants was determined for each set of random mutants. It was found that
  43 out of the 263 amino acid residues do not tolerate substitutions and therefore
  are critical for the structure and activity of the enzyme. In addition, a comparison
  of conserved residue positions among functional $β$-lactamase mutants with conserved
  residues in the P-lactamase gene family identified many positions which did not
  tolerate substitutions in the mutagenesis studies but are freely substituted among
  members of the gene family. This observation may be due to the accumulation of compensating
  mutations among members of the gene family. Finally, the sequence variability at
  residue positions among functional mutants was quantitated by calculating the effective
  number of substitutions at each position using information-theoretical entropy.
  These values were used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the correlation between
  the sequence variability at a position and the fractional accessible surface area
  of the residue. The correlation is found to be statistically significant in that
  buried residues tend to exhibit low variability and invariant residues tend to exhibit
  low solvent exposure. However, the correlation is weak because most residues are
  neither completely buried nor invariant.
