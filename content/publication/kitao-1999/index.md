abstract: Currently, collective coordinates are commonly employed in order to examine
  protein dynamics. In recent studies, they have been successfully applied to finding
  functionally relevant motions, to investigating the physical nature of protein dynamics,
  to sampling of the conformational space and to the analysis of experimental data.
  Collective coordinates also have other possible applications.
