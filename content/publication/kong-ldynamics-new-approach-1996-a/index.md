abstract: We present a novel and efficient method for performing free energy calculations.
  Treating the conventional $łambda$ variables associated with the ``progress'' in
  the chemical coordinates dynamically, our approach transforms free energy calculations
  into calculating potentials of mean force in the $łambda$-space with molecular dynamics.
  This extended Hamiltonian formalism utilizes the full power of umbrella sampling
  techniques and the weighted histogram analysis method. Applications to free energies
  of hydration and a model illustrating competitive binding calculations are presented.
  These calculations demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of the new $łambda$-dynamics
  approach.
