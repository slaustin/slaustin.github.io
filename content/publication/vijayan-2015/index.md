abstract: Structural coverage of the human kinome has been steadily increasing over
  time. The structures provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of kinase
  function and also provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of kinase
  inhibitors. There are a large number of kinase structures in the PDB for which the
  Asp and Phe of the DFG motif on the activation loop swap positions, resulting in
  the formation of a new allosteric pocket. We refer to these structures as \"classical
  DFG-out\" conformations in order to distinguish them from conformations that have
  also been referred to as DFG-out in the literature but that do not have a fully
  formed allosteric pocket. We have completed a structural analysis of almost 200
  small molecule inhibitors bound to classical DFG-out conformations; we find that
  they are recognized by both type I and type II inhibitors. In contrast, we find
  that nonclassical DFG-out conformations strongly select against type II inhibitors
  because these structures have not formed a large enough allosteric pocket to accommodate
  this type of binding mode. In the course of this study we discovered that the number
  of structurally validated type II inhibitors that can be found in the PDB and that
  are also represented in publicly available biochemical profiling studies of kinase
  inhibitors is very small. We have obtained new profiling results for several additional
  structurally validated type II inhibitors identified through our conformational
  analysis. Although the available profiling data for type II inhibitors is still
  much smaller than for type I inhibitors, a comparison of the two data sets supports
  the conclusion that type II inhibitors are more selective than type I. We comment
  on the possible contribution of the DFG-in to DFG-out conformational reorganization
  to the selectivity.
