abstract: In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences
  by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged
  as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple
  concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is
  added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian
  devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This
  means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing
  reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner
  is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements
  for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the
  adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from
  in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and
  extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems
  in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive,
  self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability,
  and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy
  calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are
  examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers
  in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but
  also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this
  paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of
  the computed free-energy differences are proposed.
