abstract: The maximum entropy method (MEM) is used to numerically invert the kinetics
  of ligand rebinding at low temperatures to obtain the underlying two-dimensional
  distribution of activation enthalpies and entropies, g(H,S). A global analysis of
  the rebinding of carbon monoxide (CO) to myoglobin (Mb), monitored in the Soret
  band at temperatures from 60 to 150 K, is performed using a Newton-Raphson optimization
  algorithm. The MEM approach describes the data much better than traditional least-squares
  analyses, reducing $Ï‡$2by an order of magnitude. The MEM resolves two barrier distributions
  suggestive of rebinding to different bound conformations of MbCO, the so-called
  A1and A3substates, whose activation barriers have been independently estimated from
  kinetics monitored in the infrared. The distribution corresponding to A3possesses
  higher activation entropies, also consistent with infrared measurements. Within
  an A substate, correlations of S and H are recovered qualitatively from simulated
  data but can be difficult to obtain from experimental data. When the rebinding measured
  at 60 K is excluded from the inversion, two peaks are no longer clearly resolved.
  Thus, data of very high quality are required to unambiguously determine the kinetic
  resolvability of subpopulations and the shape of the barrier distribution for a
  single A substate.
