abstract: Allostery is the process by which biological macromolecules (mostly proteins)
  transmit the effect of binding at one site to another, often distal, functional
  site, allowing for regulation of activity. Recent experimental observations demonstrating
  that allostery can be facilitated by dynamic and intrinsically disordered proteins
  have resulted in a new paradigm for understanding allosteric mechanisms, which focuses
  on the conformational ensemble and the statistical nature of the interactions responsible
  for the transmission of information. Analysis of allosteric ensembles reveals a
  rich spectrum of regulatory strategies, as well as a framework to unify the description
  of allosteric mechanisms from different systems. oÌ§pyright 2014 Macmillan Publishers
