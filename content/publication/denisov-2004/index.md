abstract: Using magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD), we have previously shown that
  the four internal water molecules in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)
  exchange with bulk water on time scales between 10-8 and 10 -4 s at room temperature.
  Because this exchange is controlled by the protein structure, internal water molecules
  can be used to probe rare conformational fluctuations. Here, we report 2H and 17O
  MRD data at three temperatures for wild-type BPTI and two BPTI variants where the
  14-38 disulfide bond has been cleaved by a double Cys $i̊ghtarrow$ Ser mutation
  or by disulfide reduction and carboxamido-methylation. The MRD data show that the
  internal water molecules are conserved on disulfide cleavage, However, the exchange
  rate of the water molecule buried near the disulfide bond is enhanced by 2-4 orders
  of magnitude. The relation of water exchange to other dynamic processes in BPTI
  is discussed.
