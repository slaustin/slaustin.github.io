abstract: AbstractDeclining efficiency of antibiotic-inhibitor combinatorial therapies
  in treating beta-lactamase mediated resistance necessitates novel inhibitor development.
  Allosteric inhibition offers an alternative to conventional drugs that target the
  conserved active site. Here, we show that the evolutionarily conserved PWP triad
  located at the N-terminus of the H10 helix directly interacts with the allosteric
  site in TEM-1 beta-lactamase and regulates its activity. While point mutations in
  the PWP triad preserve the overall secondary structures around the allosteric site,
  they result in a more open and dynamic global structure with decreased chemical
  stability and increased aggregation propensity. These mutant enzymes with a less
  compact hydrophobic core around the allosteric site displayed significant activity
  loss. Detailed sequence and structure conservation analyses revealed that the PWP
  triad is an evolutionarily conserved motif unique to class A beta-lactamases aligning
  its allosteric site and hence i...
