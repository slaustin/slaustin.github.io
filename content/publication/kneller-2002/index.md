abstract: Analysis of the ratio of transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates (R2/R1)
  is an approach commonly used for estimation of overall correlation time and identification
  of chemical exchange in biological macromolecules. However, this analysis fails
  to distinguish between chemical exchange and motional anisotropy. We describe a
  simple method for identifying chemical exchange and motional anisotropy using the
  product, R1R2. In the slow tumbling regime, the R1R2 product results in a constant
  value that is independent of overall correlation time and motional anisotropy. This
  analysis provides a simple method for rapidly estimating and dissociating the effects
  of motional anisotropy and chemical exchange in NMR heteronuclear spin relaxation
  data. We demonstrate the utility of the method with 15N relaxation data collected
  on the proteins E. coli ribonuclease H and the trimeric E. coli membrane associated
  lipoprotein lpp.
