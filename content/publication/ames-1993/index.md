abstract: 'This is the greatly revised and greatly expanded Second Edition of the
  hugely popular Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. The product of
  a unique collaboration among four leading scientists in academic research and industry
  Numerical Recipes is a complete text and reference book on scientific computing.
  In a self-contained manner it proceeds from mathematical and theoretical considerations
  to actual practical computer routines. With over 100 new routines bringing the total
  to well over 300, plus upgraded versions of the original routines, this new edition
  remains the most practical, comprehensive handbook of scientific computing available
  today. Highlights of the new material include: -A new chapter on integral equations
  and inverse methods -Multigrid and other methods for solving partial differential
  equations -Improved random number routines - Wavelet transforms -The statistical
  bootstrap method -A new chapter on \"less-numerical\" algorithms including compression
  coding and arbitrary precision arithmetic. The book retains the informal easy-to-read
  style that made the first edition so popular, while introducing some more advanced
  topics. It is an ideal textbook for scientists and engineers and an indispensable
  reference for anyone who works in scientific computing. The Second Edition is availabe
  in FORTRAN, the traditional language for numerical calculations and in the increasingly
  popular C language.'
