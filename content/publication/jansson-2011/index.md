abstract: For the first time, a systematic investigation of the glass transition and
  its related dynamics of myoglobin in water-glycerol solvent mixtures of different
  water contents is presented. By a combination of broadband dielectric spectroscopy
  and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we have studied the relation between
  the protein and solvent dynamics with the aim to better understand the calorimetric
  glass transition, Tg, of proteins and the role of solvent for protein dynamics.
  The results show that both the viscosity related $α$-relaxation in the solvent as
  well as several different protein relaxations are involved in the calorimetric glass
  transition, and that the broadness ($δ$Tg) of the transition depends strongly on
  the total amount of solvent. The main reason for this seems to be that the protein
  relaxation processes become more separated in time with decreasing solvent level.
  The results are compared to that of hydrated myoglobin where the hydration water
  does not give any direct contribution to the calorimetric T g. However, the large-scale
  $α$-like relaxation in the hydration water is still responsible for the protein
  dynamics that freeze-in at T g. Finally, the dielectric data show clearly that the
  protein relaxation processes exhibit similar temperature dependences as the $α$-relaxation
  in the solvent, as suggested for solvent-slaved protein motions. o̧pyright 2011
