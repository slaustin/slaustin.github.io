abstract: The catalytic activity of many protein kinases is controlled by conformational
  changes of a conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif. We used an infrared probe to track
  the DFG motif of the mitotic kinase Aurora A (AurA) and found that allosteric activation
  by the spindle-associated protein Tpx2 involves an equilibrium shift toward the
  active DFG-in state. FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer experiments show that the
  activation loop undergoes a nanometer-scale movement that is tightly coupled to
  the DFG equilibrium. Tpx2 further activates AurA by stabilizing a water-mediated
  allosteric network that links the C-helix to the active site through an unusual
  polar residue in the regulatory spine. The polar spine residue and water network
  of AurA are essential for phosphorylation-driven activation, but an alternative
  form of the water network found in related kinases can support Tpx2-driven activation,
  suggesting that variations in the water-mediated hydrogen bond network mediate regulatory
  diversification in protein kinases.
