abstract: The SURFNET program generates molecular surfaces and gaps between surfaces
  from 3D coordinates supplied in a PDB-format file. The gap regions can correspond
  to the voids between two or more molecules, or to the internal cavities and surface
  grooves within a single molecule. The program is particularly useful in clearly
  delineating the regions of the active site of a protein. It can also generate 3D
  contour surfaces of the density distributions of any set of 3D data points. All
  output surfaces can be viewed interactively, along with the molecules or data points
  in question, using some of the best-known molecular modeling packages. In addition,
  PostScript output is available, and the generated surfaces can be rendered using
  various other graphics packages. oÌ§pyright 1995.
