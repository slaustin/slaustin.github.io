abstract: 'Large-scale protein conformational motions on nanosecond-microsecond time
  scales are important for many biological processes, but remain largely unexplored
  because of methodological limitations. NMR relaxation methods can access these time
  scales if protein tumbling is prevented, but the isotropy required for high-resolution
  solution NMR is then lost. However, if the immobilized protein molecules are randomly
  oriented, the water 2H and 17O spins relax as in a solution of freely tumbling protein
  molecules, with the crucial difference that they now sample motions on all time
  scales up to approximately 100 micros. In particular, the exchange rates of internal
  water molecules can be determined directly from the 2H or 17O magnetic relaxation
  dispersion (MRD) profile. This possibility opens up a new window for characterizing
  the motions of individual internal water molecules as well as the large-scale protein
  conformational fluctuations that govern the exchange rates of structural water molecules.
  We introduce and validate this new NMR method by presenting and analyzing an extensive
  set of 2H and 17O MRD data from cross-linked gels of two model proteins: bovine
  pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and ubiquitin. We determine residence times and order
  parameters of four internal water molecules in these proteins and show that they
  are quantitatively consistent with the information available from crystallography
  and solution MRD. We also show how slow motions of side-chains bearing labile hydrogens
  can be monitored by the same approach. Proteins of any size can be studied at physiological
  hydration levels with this method.'
