abstract: Although antibody-based therapeutics have become firmly established as medicines
  for serious diseases, the value of antibodies as tools in the early stages of small-molecule
  drug discovery is only beginning to be realized. In particular, antibodies may provide
  information to reduce risk in small-molecule drug discovery by enabling the validation
  of targets and by providing insights into the design of small-molecule screening
  assays. Moreover, antibodies can act as guides in the quest for small molecules
  that have the ability to modulate protein-protein interactions, which have traditionally
  only been considered to be tractable targets for biological drugs. The development
  of small molecules that have similar therapeutic effects to current biologics has
  the potential to benefit a broader range of patients at earlier stages of disease.
