abstract: We have developed a new simulation algorithm for free-energy calculations.
  The method is a multidimensional extension of the replica-exchange method. While
  pairs of replicas with different temperatures are exchanged during the simulation
  in the original replica-exchange method, pairs of replicas with different temperatures
  and/or different parameters of the potential energy are exchanged in the new algorithm.
  This greatly enhances the sampling of the conformational space and allows accurate
  calculations of free energy in a wide temperature range from a single simulation
  run, using the weighted histogram analysis method.
