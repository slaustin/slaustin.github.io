abstract: We introduce the general transition-based reweighting analysis method (TRAM),
  a statistically optimal approach to integrate both unbiased and biased molecular
  dynamics simulations, such as umbrella sampling or replica exchange. TRAM estimates
  a multiensemble Markov model (MEMM) with full thermodynamic and kinetic information
  at all ensembles. The approach combines the benefits of Markov state models---clustering
  of high-dimensional spaces and modeling of complex many-state systems---with those
  of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio of exploiting biased or high-temperature
  ensembles to accelerate rare-event sampling. TRAM does not depend on any rate model
  in addition to the widely used Markov state model approximation, but uses only fundamental
  relations such as detailed balance and binless reweighting of configurations between
  ensembles. Previous methods, including the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio,
  discrete TRAM, and Markov state models are special cases and can be derived from
  the TRAM equations. TRAM is demonstrated by efficiently computing MEMMs in cases
  where other estimators break down, including the full thermodynamics and rare-event
  kinetics from high-dimensional simulation data of an all-atom protein--ligand binding
  model.
