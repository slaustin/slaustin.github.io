abstract: Human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (HsPNP) is a target for inhibitor
  development aiming at T-cell immune response modulation. In this work, we report
  the development of a new set of empirical scoring functions and its application
  to evaluate binding affinities and docking results. To test these new functions,
  we solved the structure of HsPNP and 2-mercapto-4(3H)-quinazolinone (HsPNP:MQU)
  binary complex at 2.7 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation, and used these functions
  to predict ligand position obtained in docking simulations. We also employed molecular
  dynamics simulations to analyze HsPNP in two conditions, as apoenzyme and in the
  binary complex form, in order to assess the structural features responsible for
  stability. Analysis of the structural differences between systems provides explanation
  for inhibitor binding. The use of these scoring functions to evaluate binding affinities
  and molecular docking results may be used to guide future efforts on virtual screening
  focused on HsPNP. o̧pyright 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
