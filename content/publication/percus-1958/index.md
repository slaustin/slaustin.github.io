abstract: The three-dimensional classical many-body system is approximated by the
  use of collective coordinates, through the assumed knowledge of two-body correlation
  functions. The resulting approximate statistical state is used to obtain the two-body
  correlation function. Thus, a self-consistent formulation is available for determining
  the correlation function. Then, the self-consistent integral equation is solved
  in virial expansion, and the thermodynamic quantities of the system thereby ascertained.
  The first three virial coefficients are exactly reproduced, while the fourth is
  nearly correct, as evidenced by numerical results for the case of hard spheres.
