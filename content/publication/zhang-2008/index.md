abstract: 'Background: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid
  sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural
  biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments
  have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of
  the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of
  the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous
  requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of
  the I-TASSER predictions. Results: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at
  the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions
  for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function
  (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus
  significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the
  accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates
  a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity
  measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient
  of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff $>$-1.5 for the models of correct topology, both
  false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein
  length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error
  of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 Å for RMSD. Conclusion: The I-TASSER server has been
  developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where
  the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of
  the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up
  to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD,
  and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available
