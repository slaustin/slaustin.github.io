 abstract = {This review deals with dynamics of water molecules in the hydration layer that surrounds self-assemblies and proteins in aqueous solutions. This topic has not only seen a vigorous upsurge of interest in the past decade1-5 but also has been a subject of investigation for almost half a century now. The basic motivation behind such studies is that they provide valuable information regarding the structure and dynamics of hydration layers and also about the dynamics of self-assemblies and biomolecules themselves. Perhaps the perception about this problem was aptly voiced by Robinson et al. a few years ago when they observed that this "is the most important problem in science that hardly anyone wants to see solved."6 While one may certainly argue over the superlative used and the skepticism voiced, the need for a better understanding of this important problem was apparent. Fortunately, considerable progress has been made in recent years by the combination of a host of experimental, theoretical, and computer simulation techniques. We aim to review a part of this progress. Because the existing literature is huge, my review may not be exhaustive but I hope to address at least some of the key issues. A myriad of anomalous features in the dynamics of neat water have always posed interesting challenges to theoreticians and experimentalists alike. For example, while the viscosity of neat water at room temperature is quite large (for such a small and light molecule) and the rotational relaxation of a water molecule is quite slow (as compared to, for example, acetonitrile), the polar solvation dynamics (SD) in liquid water is exceedingly fast.4,7-27 Clearly, the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network, small moment of inertia, high dipole moment, and high dielectric constant of water combine to give dynamics ranging over wide time scales. The characteristic features of water molecules near an interface,2-4 where the HB network gets locally disrupted, differ significantly from those of bulk and thus pose another set of interesting dynamical problems. This is an important issue because water molecules are found in abundance at the interfaces of proteins and DNA, and they control the structure, function, and reactivity of many natural and biological systems.28-30 Micelles and reverse micelles, microemulsions and foams, lipid vesicles, and hydrogels are some examples of systems where water at the interface is different from that in the bulk. Without the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, the protein structure is not stable and it cannot function. The shell of water around DNA is essential for replication and transcription. Intercalation of anticancer drugs into DNA also involves active participation of water molecules.31 Water-mediated interactions play an important role in biomolecular recognition processes.32 However, the detailed role of water in many of these processes is yet to be established. To emphasize the difference between water molecules at the surface of biomolecules and self-assemblies and those in the bulk, one often represents the former as a hydration layer, which is assumed to be a distinct entity. In Figure 1, we schematically illustrate the so-called hydration layer. Obviously, such a layer is partly real and partly imaginary but it serves a useful purpose. To characterize this layer, one would like to know the time scale of motion of water molecules within it. The dynamics of water in this hydration layer is partly determined by and reflected in the HB lifetime kinetics, which in turn depends on the structure of the layer induced by the macromolecular surface.},
