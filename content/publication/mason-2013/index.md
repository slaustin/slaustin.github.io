abstract: PURPOSE:G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of therapeutically
  important proteins and as diverse X-ray structures become available it is increasingly
  possible to leverage structural information for rational drug design.We present
  herein approaches that use explicit water networks combined with energetic surveys
  of the binding site (GRID), providing an enhanced druggability and ligand design
  approach, with structural understanding of ligand binding, including a 'magic' methyl
  and binding site mutations, and a fast new approach to generate and score waters.METHODS:The
  GRID program was used to identify lipophilic and hydrogen bonding hotspots. Explicit
  full water networks were generated and scored for (pseudo)apo structures and ligand-protein
  complexes using a new approach, WaterFLAP (Molecular Discovery), together with WaterMap
  (Schrodinger) for (pseudo)apo structures. A scoring function (MetaScore) was developed
  using a fast computational protocol based on several short adiabatic biased MD simulations
  followed by multiple short well-tempered metadynamics runs.RESULTS:Analysis of diverse
  ligands binding to the adenosine A2A receptor together with new structures for the
  delta/kappa/mu opioid and CCR5 receptors confirmed the key role of lipophilic hotspots
  in driving ligand binding and thus design; the displacement of 'unhappy' waters
  generally found in these regions provides a key binding energy component. Complete
  explicit water networks could be robustly generated for protein-ligand complexes
  using a WaterFLAP based approach. They provide a structural understanding of structure-activity
  relationships such as a 'magic methyl' effect and with the metadynamics approach
  a useful estimation of the binding energy changes resulting from active site mutations.CONCLUSIONS:The
  promise of full structure-based drug design (SBDD) for GPCRs is now possible using
  a combination of advanced experimental and computational data. The conformational
  thermostabilisation of StaR(R) proteins provide the ability to easily generate biophysical
  screening data (binding including fragments, kinetics) and to get crystal structures
  with both potent and weak ligands. Explicit water networks for apo and ligand-complex
  structures are a critical 'third dimension' for SBDD and are key for understanding
  ligand binding energies and kinetics. GRID lipophilic hotspots are found to be key
  drivers for binding. In this context 'high end' GPCR ligand design is now enabled.
