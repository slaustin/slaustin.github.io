abstract: Realistic modeling of biomolecular systems requires an accurate treatment
  of electrostatics, including electronic polarization. Due to recent advances in
  physical models, simulation algorithms, and computing hardware, biomolecular simulations
  with advanced force fields at biologically relevant timescales are becoming increasingly
  promising. These advancements have not only led to new biophysical insights but
  also afforded opportunities to advance our understanding of fundamental intermolecular
  forces. This article describes the recent advances and applications, as well as
  future directions, of polarizable force fields in biomolecular simulations.
