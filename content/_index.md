      title: 'My Research Focus'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        The discovery of novel drugs and drug targets is the motivation for research spanning a diverse spectrum of scientific disciplines. My aim is at the atomic-scale, where I utilize computer simulations of drugs and their protein targets to understand the physical basis of their complex interactions. A great focus of my work is on the development of enhanced sampling methodologies that bolster our ability to observe long-timescale dynamics critical to enzymatic functionality. In an effort to convert these observations into knowledge, I also create novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to detect hidden drug binding sites and investigate how they modulate enzymatic function.
